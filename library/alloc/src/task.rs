/// The implementation of waking a task on an executor.
///
/// This trait can be used to create a [`Waker`]. An executor can define an
/// implementation of this trait, and use that to construct a Waker to pass
/// to the tasks that are executed on that executor.
///
/// This trait is a memory-safe and ergonomic alternative to constructing a
/// [`RawWaker`]. It supports the common executor design in which the data used
/// to wake up a task is stored in an [`Arc`]. Some executors (especially
/// those for embedded systems) cannot use this API, which is why [`RawWaker`]
/// exists as an alternative for those systems.
///
/// [arc]: ../../std/sync/struct.Arc.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A basic `block_on` function that takes a future and runs it to completion on
/// the current thread.
///
/// **Note:** This example trades correctness for simplicity. In order to prevent
/// deadlocks, production-grade implementations will also need to handle
/// intermediate calls to `thread::unpark` as well as nested invocations.
///
/// ```crablang
/// use std::future::Future;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use std::task::{Context, Poll, Wake};
/// use std::thread::{self, Thread};
///
/// /// A waker that wakes up the current thread when called.
/// struct ThreadWaker(Thread);
///
/// impl Wake for ThreadWaker {
///     fn wake(self: Arc<Self>) {
///         self.0.unpark();

/// /// Run a future to completion on the current thread.
/// fn block_on<T>(fut: impl Future<Output = T>) -> T {
///     // Pin the future so it can be polled.
///     let mut fut = Box::pin(fut);

///     // Create a new context to be passed to the future.
///     let t = thread::current();
