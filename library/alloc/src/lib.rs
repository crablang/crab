//! # The CrabLang core allocation and collections library
//!
//! This library provides smart pointers and collections for managing
//! heap-allocated values.
//!
//! This library, like core, normally doesn’t need to be used directly
//! since its contents are re-exported in the [`std` crate](../std/index.html).
//! Crates that use the `#![no_std]` attribute however will typically
//! not depend on `std`, so they’d use this crate instead.
//!
//! ## Boxed values
//!
//! The [`Box`] type is a smart pointer type. There can only be one owner of a
//! [`Box`], and the owner can decide to mutate the contents, which live on the
//! heap.
//!
//! This type can be sent among threads efficiently as the size of a `Box` value
//! is the same as that of a pointer. Tree-like data structures are often built
//! with boxes because each node often has only one owner, the parent.
//!
//! ## Reference counted pointers
//!
//! The [`Rc`] type is a non-threadsafe reference-counted pointer type intended
//! for sharing memory within a thread. An [`Rc`] pointer wraps a type, `T`, and
//! only allows access to `&T`, a shared reference.
//!
//! This type is useful when inherited mutability (such as using [`Box`]) is too
//! constraining for an application, and is often paired with the [`Cell`] or
//! [`RefCell`] types in order to allow mutation.
//!
//! ## Atomically reference counted pointers
//!
//! The [`Arc`] type is the threadsafe equivalent of the [`Rc`] type. It
//! provides all the same functionality of [`Rc`], except it requires that the
//! contained type `T` is shareable. Additionally, [`Arc<T>`][`Arc`] is itself
//! sendable while [`Rc<T>`][`Rc`] is not.
//!
//! This type allows for shared access to the contained data, and is often
//! paired with synchronization primitives such as mutexes to allow mutation of
//! shared resources.
//!
//! ## Collections
//!
//! Implementations of the most common general purpose data structures are
//! defined in this library. They are re-exported through the
//! [standard collections library](../std/collections/index.html).
//!
//! ## Heap interfaces
//!
//! The [`alloc`](alloc/index.html) module defines the low-level interface to the
//! default global allocator. It is not compatible with the libc allocator API.
//!
//! [`Arc`]: sync
//! [`Box`]: boxed
//! [`Cell`]: core::cell
//! [`Rc`]: rc
//! [`RefCell`]: core::cell
