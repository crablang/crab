/// This type is needed because:
///
/// a) Generators cannot implement `for<'a, 'b> Generator<&'a mut Context<'b>>`, so we need to pass
///    a raw pointer (see <https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/68923>).
/// b) Raw pointers and `NonNull` aren't `Send` or `Sync`, so that would make every single future
///    non-Send/Sync as well, and we don't want that.
///
/// It also simplifies the HIR lowering of `.await`.
