/// Forms a slice from a pointer and a length.

/// The `len` argument is the number of **elements**, not the number of bytes.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:
///
/// * `data` must be [valid] for reads for `len * mem::size_of::<T>()` many bytes,
///   and it must be properly aligned. This means in particular:
///
///     * The entire memory range of this slice must be contained within a single allocated object!
///       Slices can never span across multiple allocated objects. See [below](#incorrect-usage)
///       for an example incorrectly not taking this into account.
///     * `data` must be non-null and aligned even for zero-length slices. One
///       reason for this is that enum layout optimizations may rely on references
///       (including slices of any length) being aligned and non-null to distinguish
///       them from other data. You can obtain a pointer that is usable as `data`
///       for zero-length slices using [`NonNull::dangling()`].
///
/// * `data` must point to `len` consecutive properly initialized values of type `T`.
///
/// * The memory referenced by the returned slice must not be mutated for the duration
///   of lifetime `'a`, except inside an `UnsafeCell`.
///
/// * The total size `len * mem::size_of::<T>()` of the slice must be no larger than `isize::MAX`.
///   See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].

/// annotation.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::slice;
///
/// // manifest a slice for a single element
/// let x = 42;
/// let ptr = &x as *const _;
/// let slice = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, 1) };

/// ```crablang,no_run
/// use std::slice;
///
/// fn join_slices<'a, T>(fst: &'a [T], snd: &'a [T]) -> &'a [T] {
///     let fst_end = fst.as_ptr().wrapping_add(fst.len());
///     let snd_start = snd.as_ptr();
///     assert_eq!(fst_end, snd_start, "Slices must be contiguous!");
///     unsafe {
///         // The assertion above ensures `fst` and `snd` are contiguous, but they might
///         // still be contained within _different allocated objects_, in which case
///         // creating this slice is undefined behavior.
///         slice::from_raw_parts(fst.as_ptr(), fst.len() + snd.len())
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     // `a` and `b` are different allocated objects...
///     let a = 42;
///     let b = 27;
///     // ... which may nevertheless be laid out contiguously in memory: | a | b |
///     let _ = join_slices(slice::from_ref(&a), slice::from_ref(&b)); // UB
