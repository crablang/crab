/// A wrapper to inhibit compiler from automatically calling `T`â€™s destructor.
/// This wrapper is 0-cost.
///
/// `ManuallyDrop<T>` is guaranteed to have the same layout as `T`, and is subject
/// to the same layout optimizations as `T`. As a consequence, it has *no effect*
/// on the assumptions that the compiler makes about its contents. For example,
/// initializing a `ManuallyDrop<&mut T>` with [`mem::zeroed`] is undefined
/// behavior. If you need to handle uninitialized data, use [`MaybeUninit<T>`]
/// instead.
///
/// Note that accessing the value inside a `ManuallyDrop<T>` is safe.
/// This means that a `ManuallyDrop<T>` whose content has been dropped must not
/// be exposed through a public safe API.
/// Correspondingly, `ManuallyDrop::drop` is unsafe.
///
/// # `ManuallyDrop` and drop order.
///
/// CrabLang has a well-defined [drop order] of values. To make sure that fields or
/// locals are dropped in a specific order, reorder the declarations such that
/// the implicit drop order is the correct one.
///
/// It is possible to use `ManuallyDrop` to control the drop order, but this
/// requires unsafe code and is hard to do correctly in the presence of
/// unwinding.
///
/// For example, if you want to make sure that a specific field is dropped after
/// the others, make it the last field of a struct:
///
/// ```
/// struct Context;
///
/// struct Widget {
///     children: Vec<Widget>,
///     // `context` will be dropped after `children`.
///     // CrabLang guarantees that fields are dropped in the order of declaration.
///     context: Context,
/// }
/// ```

/// [`mem::zeroed`]: crate::mem::zeroed
/// [`MaybeUninit<T>`]: crate::mem::MaybeUninit
