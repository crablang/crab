//! Utilities for comparing and ordering values.
//!
//! This module contains various tools for comparing and ordering values. In
//! summary:
//!
//! * [`Eq`] and [`PartialEq`] are traits that allow you to define total and
//!   partial equality between values, respectively. Implementing them overloads
//!   the `==` and `!=` operators.
//! * [`Ord`] and [`PartialOrd`] are traits that allow you to define total and
//!   partial orderings between values, respectively. Implementing them overloads
//!   the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` operators.
//! * [`Ordering`] is an enum returned by the main functions of [`Ord`] and
//!   [`PartialOrd`], and describes an ordering.
//! * [`Reverse`] is a struct that allows you to easily reverse an ordering.
//! * [`max`] and [`min`] are functions that build off of [`Ord`] and allow you
//!   to find the maximum or minimum of two values.
//!
//! For more details, see the respective documentation of each item in the list.
//!
//! [`max`]: Ord::max
//! [`min`]: Ord::min

/// Trait for equality comparisons.
///
/// `x.eq(y)` can also be written `x == y`, and `x.ne(y)` can be written `x != y`.
/// We use the easier-to-read infix notation in the remainder of this documentation.
///
/// This trait allows for partial equality, for types that do not have a full
/// equivalence relation. For example, in floating point numbers `NaN != NaN`,
/// so floating point types implement `PartialEq` but not [`trait@Eq`].
/// Formally speaking, when `Rhs == Self`, this trait corresponds to a [partial equivalence
/// relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_equivalence_relation).
///
/// Implementations must ensure that `eq` and `ne` are consistent with each other:
///
/// - `a != b` if and only if `!(a == b)`.
///
/// The default implementation of `ne` provides this consistency and is almost
/// always sufficient. It should not be overridden without very good reason.
///
/// If [`PartialOrd`] or [`Ord`] are also implemented for `Self` and `Rhs`, their methods must also
/// be consistent with `PartialEq` (see the documentation of those traits for the exact
/// requirements). It's easy to accidentally make them disagree by deriving some of the traits and
/// manually implementing others.
///
/// The equality relation `==` must satisfy the following conditions
/// (for all `a`, `b`, `c` of type `A`, `B`, `C`):
///
/// - **Symmetric**: if `A: PartialEq<B>` and `B: PartialEq<A>`, then **`a == b`
///   implies `b == a`**; and
///
/// - **Transitive**: if `A: PartialEq<B>` and `B: PartialEq<C>` and `A:
///   PartialEq<C>`, then **`a == b` and `b == c` implies `a == c`**.
///
/// Note that the `B: PartialEq<A>` (symmetric) and `A: PartialEq<C>`
/// (transitive) impls are not forced to exist, but these requirements apply
/// whenever they do exist.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`. When `derive`d on structs, two
/// instances are equal if all fields are equal, and not equal if any fields
/// are not equal. When `derive`d on enums, two instances are equal if they
/// are the same variant and all fields are equal.
///
/// ## How can I implement `PartialEq`?
///
/// An example implementation for a domain in which two books are considered
/// the same book if their ISBN matches, even if the formats differ:
///
/// ```
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// struct Book {
///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
///         self.isbn == other.isbn
///     }
/// }
///
/// let b1 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
/// let b2 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Ebook };
/// let b3 = Book { isbn: 10, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
/// assert!(b1 == b2);
/// assert!(b1 != b3);
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I compare two different types?
///
/// The type you can compare with is controlled by `PartialEq`'s type parameter.
/// For example, let's tweak our previous code a bit:
///
/// ```
/// // The derive implements <BookFormat> == <BookFormat> comparisons
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// struct Book {
///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// // Implement <Book> == <BookFormat> comparisons
/// impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &BookFormat) -> bool {
///         self.format == *other
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Implement <BookFormat> == <Book> comparisons
/// impl PartialEq<Book> for BookFormat {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Book) -> bool {
///         *self == other.format
///     }
/// }
///
/// let b1 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
/// assert!(b1 == BookFormat::Paperback);
/// assert!(BookFormat::Ebook != b1);
/// ```
///
/// By changing `impl PartialEq for Book` to `impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book`,
/// we allow `BookFormat`s to be compared with `Book`s.
///
/// A comparison like the one above, which ignores some fields of the struct,
/// can be dangerous. It can easily lead to an unintended violation of the
/// requirements for a partial equivalence relation. For example, if we kept
/// the above implementation of `PartialEq<Book>` for `BookFormat` and added an
/// implementation of `PartialEq<Book>` for `Book` (either via a `#[derive]` or
/// via the manual implementation from the first example) then the result would
/// violate transitivity:
///
/// ```should_panic
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]

///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &BookFormat) -> bool {
///         self.format == *other
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq<Book> for BookFormat {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Book) -> bool {
///         *self == other.format
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let b1 = Book { isbn: 1, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///     let b2 = Book { isbn: 2, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
///     assert!(b1 == BookFormat::Paperback);
///     assert!(BookFormat::Paperback == b2);
///
///     // The following should hold by transitivity but doesn't.
///     assert!(b1 == b2); // <-- PANICS
/// }
/// ```

/// - `max(a, b) == max_by(a, b, cmp)` (ensured by the default implementation).
/// - `min(a, b) == min_by(a, b, cmp)` (ensured by the default implementation).
/// - For `a.clamp(min, max)`, see the [method docs](#method.clamp)
///   (ensured by the default implementation).
///
/// It's easy to accidentally make `cmp` and `partial_cmp` disagree by
/// deriving some of the traits and manually implementing others.
///
/// ## Corollaries
///
/// From the above and the requirements of `PartialOrd`, it follows that `<` defines a strict total order.
/// This means that for all `a`, `b` and `c`:
///
/// - exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b` or `a > b` is true; and
/// - `<` is transitive: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`.
///
/// When `derive`d on structs, it will produce a
/// [lexicographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) ordering
/// based on the top-to-bottom declaration order of the struct's members.
///
/// When `derive`d on enums, variants are ordered by their discriminants.
/// By default, the discriminant is smallest for variants at the top, and
/// largest for variants at the bottom. Here's an example:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
/// enum E {
///     Top,
///     Bottom,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Top < E::Bottom);
/// ```
///
/// However, manually setting the discriminants can override this default
/// behavior:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
/// enum E {
///     Top = 2,
///     Bottom = 1,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Bottom < E::Top);
/// ```
///
/// ## Lexicographical comparison
///
/// Lexicographical comparison is an operation with the following properties:
///  - Two sequences are compared element by element.
///  - The first mismatching element defines which sequence is lexicographically less or greater than the other.
///  - If one sequence is a prefix of another, the shorter sequence is lexicographically less than the other.
///  - If two sequence have equivalent elements and are of the same length, then the sequences are lexicographically equal.
///  - An empty sequence is lexicographically less than any non-empty sequence.
///  - Two empty sequences are lexicographically equal.
///
/// ## How can I implement `Ord`?
///
/// `Ord` requires that the type also be [`PartialOrd`] and [`Eq`] (which requires [`PartialEq`]).
///
/// Then you must define an implementation for [`cmp`]. You may find it useful to use
/// [`cmp`] on your type's fields.
///
/// Here's an example where you want to sort people by height only, disregarding `id`
/// and `name`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cmp::Ordering;
///
/// #[derive(Eq)]
/// struct Person {
///     id: u32,
///     name: String,
///     height: u32,
/// }
///
/// impl Ord for Person {
///     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
///         self.height.cmp(&other.height)
///     }

///     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
///         Some(self.cmp(other))
///     }

///
/// The methods of this trait must be consistent with each other and with those of [`PartialEq`].
/// The following conditions must hold:
///
/// 1. `a == b` if and only if `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(Equal)`.
/// 2. `a < b` if and only if `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(Less)`

/// 5. `a >= b` if and only if `a > b || a == b`
/// 6. `a != b` if and only if `!(a == b)`.

///

/// Note that these requirements mean that the trait itself must be implemented symmetrically and

/// ## How can I implement `PartialOrd`?
