//! CrabLangc internal tooling for hand-writing MIR.
//!
//! If for some reasons you are not writing crablangc tests and have found yourself considering using
//! this feature, turn back. This is *exceptionally* unstable. There is no attempt at all to make
//! anything work besides those things which the crablangc test suite happened to need. If you make a
//! typo you'll probably ICE. Really, this is not the solution to your problems. Consider instead
//! supporting the [stable MIR project group](https://github.com/crablang/project-stable-mir).
//!
//! The documentation for this module describes how to use this feature. If you are interested in
//! hacking on the implementation, most of that documentation lives at
//! `crablangc_mir_build/src/build/custom/mod.rs`.
//!
//! Typical usage will look like this:
//!
//! ```crablang
//! #![feature(core_intrinsics, custom_mir)]
//!
//! extern crate core;
//! use core::intrinsics::mir::*;
//!
//! #[custom_mir(dialect = "built")]
//! pub fn simple(x: i32) -> i32 {
//!     mir!(
//!         let temp2: i32;
//!
//!         {
//!             let temp1 = x;
//!             Goto(my_second_block)
//!         }
//!
//!         my_second_block = {
//!             temp2 = Move(temp1);
//!             RET = temp2;
//!             Return()
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The `custom_mir` attribute tells the compiler to treat the function as being custom MIR. This
//! attribute only works on functions - there is no way to insert custom MIR into the middle of
//! another function. The `dialect` and `phase` parameters indicate which [version of MIR][dialect
//! docs] you are inserting here. Generally you'll want to use `#![custom_mir(dialect = "built")]`
//! if you want your MIR to be modified by the full MIR pipeline, or `#![custom_mir(dialect =
//! "runtime", phase = "optimized")]` if you don't.
//!
//! [dialect docs]:
//!     https://doc.crablang.org/nightly/nightly-crablangc/crablangc_middle/mir/enum.MirPhase.html
//!
//! The input to the [`mir!`] macro is:
//!
//!  - An optional return type annotation in the form of `type RET = ...;`. This may be required
//!    if the compiler cannot infer the type of RET.
//!  - A possibly empty list of local declarations. Locals can also be declared inline on
//!    assignments via `let`. Type inference generally works. Shadowing does not.
//!  - A list of basic blocks. The first of these is the start block and is where execution begins.
//!    All blocks other than the start block need to be given a name, so that they can be referred
//!    to later.
//!     - Each block is a list of semicolon terminated statements, followed by a terminator. The
//!       syntax for the various statements and terminators is designed to be as similar as possible
//!       to the syntax for analogous concepts in native CrabLang. See below for a list.
//!

//!             Return()

//! ```
//!
//! We can also set off compilation failures that happen in sufficiently late stages of the
//! compiler:
//!
//! ```crablang,compile_fail

//!
//! # Syntax
//!
//! The lists below are an exhaustive description of how various MIR constructs can be created.
//! Anything missing from the list should be assumed to not be supported, PRs welcome.
//!
//! #### Locals
//!
//!  - The `_0` return local can always be accessed via `RET`.
//!  - Arguments can be accessed via their regular name.
//!  - All other locals need to be declared with `let` somewhere and then can be accessed by name.
//!
//! #### Places
//!  - Locals implicit convert to places.
//!  - Field accesses, derefs, and indexing work normally.
//!  - Fields in variants can be accessed via the [`Variant`] and [`Field`] associated functions,
//!    see their documentation for details.
//!
//! #### Operands
//!  - Places implicitly convert to `Copy` operands.
//!  - `Move` operands can be created via [`Move`].
//!  - Const blocks, literals, named constants, and const params all just work.
//!  - [`Static`] and [`StaticMut`] can be used to create `&T` and `*mut T`s to statics. These are
//!    constants in MIR and the only way to access statics.
//!
//! #### Statements
//!  - Assign statements work via normal CrabLang assignment.
//!  - [`Retag`], [`StorageLive`], [`StorageDead`], [`Deinit`] statements have an associated function.
//!
//! #### Rvalues
//!
//!  - Operands implicitly convert to `Use` rvalues.
//!  - `&`, `&mut`, `addr_of!`, and `addr_of_mut!` all work to create their associated rvalue.
//!  - [`Discriminant`] and [`Len`] have associated functions.
//!  - Unary and binary operations use their normal CrabLang syntax - `a * b`, `!c`, etc.
//!  - Checked binary operations are represented by wrapping the associated binop in [`Checked`].
//!  - Array repetition syntax (`[foo; 10]`) creates the associated rvalue.
//!
//! #### Terminators
//!
//! Custom MIR does not currently support cleanup blocks or non-trivial unwind paths. As such, there
//! are no resume and abort terminators, and terminators that might unwind do not have any way to
//! indicate the unwind block.
//!
//!  - [`Goto`], [`Return`], [`Unreachable`] and [`Drop`](Drop()) have associated functions.
//!  - `match some_int_operand` becomes a `SwitchInt`. Each arm should be `literal => basic_block`
//!     - The exception is the last arm, which must be `_ => basic_block` and corresponds to the
//!       otherwise branch.
//!  - [`Call`] has an associated function as well. The third argument of this function is a normal
//!    function call expresion, for example `my_other_function(a, 5)`.
//!
