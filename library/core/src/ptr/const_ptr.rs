    /// the absolute position of that memory, so we cannot tell if the pointer is
    /// null or not.

    /// let ptr: *const u8 = s.as_ptr();
    /// assert!(!ptr.is_null());

    ///       reason for this is that enum layout optimizations may rely on references
    ///       (including slices of any length) being aligned and non-null to distinguish
    ///       them from other data. You can obtain a pointer that is usable as `data`
    ///       for zero-length slices using [`NonNull::dangling()`].

    /// * The total size `ptr.len() * mem::size_of::<T>()` of the slice must be no larger than `isize::MAX`.

    ///   arbitrarily chosen and does not necessarily reflect the actual lifetime of the data.
