/// `*mut T` but non-zero and [covariant].
///
/// This is often the correct thing to use when building data structures using
/// raw pointers, but is ultimately more dangerous to use because of its additional
/// properties. If you're not sure if you should use `NonNull<T>`, just use `*mut T`!
///
/// Unlike `*mut T`, the pointer must always be non-null, even if the pointer
/// is never dereferenced. This is so that enums may use this forbidden value
/// as a discriminant -- `Option<NonNull<T>>` has the same size as `*mut T`.
/// However the pointer may still dangle if it isn't dereferenced.
///
/// Unlike `*mut T`, `NonNull<T>` was chosen to be covariant over `T`. This makes it
/// possible to use `NonNull<T>` when building covariant types, but introduces the
/// risk of unsoundness if used in a type that shouldn't actually be covariant.
/// (The opposite choice was made for `*mut T` even though technically the unsoundness
/// could only be caused by calling unsafe functions.)
///
/// Covariance is correct for most safe abstractions, such as `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `Vec`,
/// and `LinkedList`. This is the case because they provide a public API that follows the
/// normal shared XOR mutable rules of Rust.
///
/// If your type cannot safely be covariant, you must ensure it contains some
/// additional field to provide invariance. Often this field will be a [`PhantomData`]
/// type like `PhantomData<Cell<T>>` or `PhantomData<&'a mut T>`.
///
/// Notice that `NonNull<T>` has a `From` instance for `&T`. However, this does
/// not change the fact that mutating through a (pointer derived from a) shared
/// reference is undefined behavior unless the mutation happens inside an
/// [`UnsafeCell<T>`]. The same goes for creating a mutable reference from a shared
/// reference. When using this `From` instance without an `UnsafeCell<T>`,
/// it is your responsibility to ensure that `as_mut` is never called, and `as_ptr`
/// is never used for mutation.
