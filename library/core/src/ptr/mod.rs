//! Manually manage memory through raw pointers.
//!
//! *[See also the pointer primitive types](pointer).*
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Many functions in this module take raw pointers as arguments and read from
//! or write to them. For this to be safe, these pointers must be *valid*.
//! Whether a pointer is valid depends on the operation it is used for
//! (read or write), and the extent of the memory that is accessed (i.e.,
//! how many bytes are read/written). Most functions use `*mut T` and `*const T`
//! to access only a single value, in which case the documentation omits the size
//! and implicitly assumes it to be `size_of::<T>()` bytes.
//!
//! The precise rules for validity are not determined yet. The guarantees that are
//! provided at this point are very minimal:
//!
//! * A [null] pointer is *never* valid, not even for accesses of [size zero][zst].
//! * For a pointer to be valid, it is necessary, but not always sufficient, that the pointer
//!   be *dereferenceable*: the memory range of the given size starting at the pointer must all be
//!   within the bounds of a single allocated object. Note that in CrabLang,
//!   every (stack-allocated) variable is considered a separate allocated object.
//! * Even for operations of [size zero][zst], the pointer must not be pointing to deallocated
//!   memory, i.e., deallocation makes pointers invalid even for zero-sized operations. However,
//!   casting any non-zero integer *literal* to a pointer is valid for zero-sized accesses, even if
//!   some memory happens to exist at that address and gets deallocated. This corresponds to writing
//!   your own allocator: allocating zero-sized objects is not very hard. The canonical way to
//!   obtain a pointer that is valid for zero-sized accesses is [`NonNull::dangling`].
//FIXME: mention `ptr::invalid` above, once it is stable.
//! * All accesses performed by functions in this module are *non-atomic* in the sense
//!   of [atomic operations] used to synchronize between threads. This means it is
//!   undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location from different
//!   threads unless both accesses only read from memory. Notice that this explicitly
//!   includes [`read_volatile`] and [`write_volatile`]: Volatile accesses cannot
//!   be used for inter-thread synchronization.
//! * The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the
//!   underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to
//!   access the same memory. That is, reference and pointer accesses cannot be
//!   interleaved.
//!
//! These axioms, along with careful use of [`offset`] for pointer arithmetic,
//! are enough to correctly implement many useful things in unsafe code. Stronger guarantees
//! will be provided eventually, as the [aliasing] rules are being determined. For more
//! information, see the [book] as well as the section in the reference devoted
//! to [undefined behavior][ub].
//!
//! ## Alignment
//!
//! Valid raw pointers as defined above are not necessarily properly aligned (where
//! "proper" alignment is defined by the pointee type, i.e., `*const T` must be
//! aligned to `mem::align_of::<T>()`). However, most functions require their
//! arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state
//! this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are
//! [`read_unaligned`] and [`write_unaligned`].
//!
//! When a function requires proper alignment, it does so even if the access
//! has size 0, i.e., even if memory is not actually touched. Consider using
//! [`NonNull::dangling`] in such cases.
//!
//! ## Allocated object
//!
//! For several operations, such as [`offset`] or field projections (`expr.field`), the notion of an
//! "allocated object" becomes relevant. An allocated object is a contiguous region of memory.
//! Common examples of allocated objects include stack-allocated variables (each variable is a
//! separate allocated object), heap allocations (each allocation created by the global allocator is
//! a separate allocated object), and `static` variables.
//!
//! # Strict Provenance
//!
//! **The following text is non-normative, insufficiently formal, and is an extremely strict
//! interpretation of provenance. It's ok if your code doesn't strictly conform to it.**
//!
//! [Strict Provenance][] is an experimental set of APIs that help tools that try
//! to validate the memory-safety of your program's execution. Notably this includes [Miri][]
//! and [CHERI][], which can detect when you access out of bounds memory or otherwise violate
//! CrabLang's memory model.
//!
//! Provenance must exist in some form for any programming
//! language compiled for modern computer architectures, but specifying a model for provenance
//! in a way that is useful to both compilers and programmers is an ongoing challenge.
//! The [Strict Provenance][] experiment seeks to explore the question: *what if we just said you
//! couldn't do all the nasty operations that make provenance so messy?*
//!
//! What APIs would have to be removed? What APIs would have to be added? How much would code
//! have to change, and is it worse or better now? Would any patterns become truly inexpressible?
//! Could we carve out special exceptions for those patterns? Should we?
//!
//! A secondary goal of this project is to see if we can disambiguate the many functions of
//! pointer<->integer casts enough for the definition of `usize` to be loosened so that it
//! isn't *pointer*-sized but address-space/offset/allocation-sized (we'll probably continue
//! to conflate these notions). This would potentially make it possible to more efficiently
//! target platforms where pointers are larger than offsets, such as CHERI and maybe some
//! segmented architectures.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! **This section is *non-normative* and is part of the [Strict Provenance][] experiment.**
//!
//! Pointers are not *simply* an "integer" or "address". For instance, it's uncontroversial
//! to say that a Use After Free is clearly Undefined Behaviour, even if you "get lucky"
//! and the freed memory gets reallocated before your read/write (in fact this is the
//! worst-case scenario, UAFs would be much less concerning if this didn't happen!).
//! To rationalize this claim, pointers need to somehow be *more* than just their addresses:
//! they must have provenance.
//!
//! When an allocation is created, that allocation has a unique Original Pointer. For alloc
//! APIs this is literally the pointer the call returns, and for local variables and statics,
//! this is the name of the variable/static. This is mildly overloading the term "pointer"
//! for the sake of brevity/exposition.
//!
//! The Original Pointer for an allocation is guaranteed to have unique access to the entire
//! allocation and *only* that allocation. In this sense, an allocation can be thought of
//! as a "sandbox" that cannot be broken into or out of. *Provenance* is the permission
//! to access an allocation's sandbox and has both a *spatial* and *temporal* component:
//!
//! * Spatial: A range of bytes that the pointer is allowed to access.
//! * Temporal: The lifetime (of the allocation) that access to these bytes is tied to.
//!
//! Spatial provenance makes sure you don't go beyond your sandbox, while temporal provenance
//! makes sure that you can't "get lucky" after your permission to access some memory
//! has been revoked (either through deallocations or borrows expiring).
//!
//! Provenance is implicitly shared with all pointers transitively derived from
//! The Original Pointer through operations like [`offset`], borrowing, and pointer casts.
//! Some operations may *shrink* the derived provenance, limiting how much memory it can
//! access or how long it's valid for (i.e. borrowing a subfield and subslicing).
//!
//! Shrinking provenance cannot be undone: even if you "know" there is a larger allocation, you
//! can't derive a pointer with a larger provenance. Similarly, you cannot "recombine"
//! two contiguous provenances back into one (i.e. with a `fn merge(&[T], &[T]) -> &[T]`).
//!
//! A reference to a value always has provenance over exactly the memory that field occupies.
//! A reference to a slice always has provenance over exactly the range that slice describes.
//!
//! If an allocation is deallocated, all pointers with provenance to that allocation become
//! invalidated, and effectively lose their provenance.
//!
//! The strict provenance experiment is mostly only interested in exploring stricter *spatial*
//! provenance. In this sense it can be thought of as a subset of the more ambitious and
//! formal [Stacked Borrows][] research project, which is what tools like [Miri][] are based on.
//! In particular, Stacked Borrows is necessary to properly describe what borrows are allowed
//! to do and when they become invalidated. This necessarily involves much more complex
//! *temporal* reasoning than simply identifying allocations. Adjusting APIs and code
//! for the strict provenance experiment will also greatly help Stacked Borrows.
//!
//!
//! ## Pointer Vs Addresses
//!
//! **This section is *non-normative* and is part of the [Strict Provenance][] experiment.**
//!
//! One of the largest historical issues with trying to define provenance is that programmers
//! freely convert between pointers and integers. Once you allow for this, it generally becomes
//! impossible to accurately track and preserve provenance information, and you need to appeal
//! to very complex and unreliable heuristics. But of course, converting between pointers and
//! integers is very useful, so what can we do?
//!
//! Also did you know WASM is actually a "Harvard Architecture"? As in function pointers are
//! handled completely differently from data pointers? And we kind of just shipped CrabLang on WASM
//! without really addressing the fact that we let you freely convert between function pointers
//! and data pointers, because it mostly Just Works? Let's just put that on the "pointer casts
//! are dubious" pile.
//!
//! Strict Provenance attempts to square these circles by decoupling CrabLang's traditional conflation
//! of pointers and `usize` (and `isize`), and defining a pointer to semantically contain the
//! following information:
//!
//! * The **address-space** it is part of (e.g. "data" vs "code" in WASM).
//! * The **address** it points to, which can be represented by a `usize`.
//! * The **provenance** it has, defining the memory it has permission to access.
//!
//! Under Strict Provenance, a usize *cannot* accurately represent a pointer, and converting from
//! a pointer to a usize is generally an operation which *only* extracts the address. It is
//! therefore *impossible* to construct a valid pointer from a usize because there is no way
//! to restore the address-space and provenance. In other words, pointer-integer-pointer
//! roundtrips are not possible (in the sense that the resulting pointer is not dereferenceable).
//!
//! The key insight to making this model *at all* viable is the [`with_addr`][] method:
//!
//! ```text
//!     /// Creates a new pointer with the given address.
//!     ///
//!     /// This performs the same operation as an `addr as ptr` cast, but copies
//!     /// the *address-space* and *provenance* of `self` to the new pointer.
//!     /// This allows us to dynamically preserve and propagate this important
//!     /// information in a way that is otherwise impossible with a unary cast.
//!     ///
//!     /// This is equivalent to using `wrapping_offset` to offset `self` to the
//!     /// given address, and therefore has all the same capabilities and restrictions.
//!     pub fn with_addr(self, addr: usize) -> Self;
//! ```
//!
//! So you're still able to drop down to the address representation and do whatever
//! clever bit tricks you want *as long as* you're able to keep around a pointer
//! into the allocation you care about that can "reconstitute" the other parts of the pointer.
//! Usually this is very easy, because you only are taking a pointer, messing with the address,
//! and then immediately converting back to a pointer. To make this use case more ergonomic,
//! we provide the [`map_addr`][] method.
//!
//! To help make it clear that code is "following" Strict Provenance semantics, we also provide an
//! [`addr`][] method which promises that the returned address is not part of a
//! pointer-usize-pointer roundtrip. In the future we may provide a lint for pointer<->integer
//! casts to help you audit if your code conforms to strict provenance.
//!
//!
//! ## Using Strict Provenance
//!
//! Most code needs no changes to conform to strict provenance, as the only really concerning
//! operation that *wasn't* obviously already Undefined Behaviour is casts from usize to a
//! pointer. For code which *does* cast a usize to a pointer, the scope of the change depends
//! on exactly what you're doing.
//!
//! In general you just need to make sure that if you want to convert a usize address to a
//! pointer and then use that pointer to read/write memory, you need to keep around a pointer
//! that has sufficient provenance to perform that read/write itself. In this way all of your
//! casts from an address to a pointer are essentially just applying offsets/indexing.
//!
//! This is generally trivial to do for simple cases like tagged pointers *as long as you
//! represent the tagged pointer as an actual pointer and not a usize*. For instance:
//!
//! ```
//! #![feature(strict_provenance)]
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     // A flag we want to pack into our pointer
//!     static HAS_DATA: usize = 0x1;
//!     static FLAG_MASK: usize = !HAS_DATA;
//!
//!     // Our value, which must have enough alignment to have spare least-significant-bits.
//!     let my_precious_data: u32 = 17;
//!     assert!(core::mem::align_of::<u32>() > 1);
//!
//!     // Create a tagged pointer
//!     let ptr = &my_precious_data as *const u32;
//!     let tagged = ptr.map_addr(|addr| addr | HAS_DATA);
//!
//!     // Check the flag:
//!     if tagged.addr() & HAS_DATA != 0 {
//!         // Untag and read the pointer
//!         let data = *tagged.map_addr(|addr| addr & FLAG_MASK);
//!         assert_eq!(data, 17);
//!     } else {
//!         unreachable!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! (Yes, if you've been using AtomicUsize for pointers in concurrent datastructures, you should
//! be using AtomicPtr instead. If that messes up the way you atomically manipulate pointers,
//! we would like to know why, and what needs to be done to fix it.)
//!
//! Something more complicated and just generally *evil* like an XOR-List requires more significant
//! changes like allocating all nodes in a pre-allocated Vec or Arena and using a pointer
//! to the whole allocation to reconstitute the XORed addresses.
//!
//! Situations where a valid pointer *must* be created from just an address, such as baremetal code
//! accessing a memory-mapped interface at a fixed address, are an open question on how to support.
//! These situations *will* still be allowed, but we might require some kind of "I know what I'm
//! doing" annotation to explain the situation to the compiler. It's also possible they need no
//! special attention at all, because they're generally accessing memory outside the scope of
//! "the abstract machine", or already using "I know what I'm doing" annotations like "volatile".
//!
//! Under [Strict Provenance] it is Undefined Behaviour to:
//!
//! * Access memory through a pointer that does not have provenance over that memory.
//!
//! * [`offset`] a pointer to or from an address it doesn't have provenance over.
//!   This means it's always UB to offset a pointer derived from something deallocated,
//!   even if the offset is 0. Note that a pointer "one past the end" of its provenance
//!   is not actually outside its provenance, it just has 0 bytes it can load/store.
//!
//! But it *is* still sound to:
//!
//! * Create an invalid pointer from just an address (see [`ptr::invalid`][]). This can
//!   be used for sentinel values like `null` *or* to represent a tagged pointer that will
//!   never be dereferenceable. In general, it is always sound for an integer to pretend
//!   to be a pointer "for fun" as long as you don't use operations on it which require
//!   it to be valid (offset, read, write, etc).
//!
//! * Forge an allocation of size zero at any sufficiently aligned non-null address.
//!   i.e. the usual "ZSTs are fake, do what you want" rules apply *but* this only applies
//!   for actual forgery (integers cast to pointers). If you borrow some struct's field
//!   that *happens* to be zero-sized, the resulting pointer will have provenance tied to
//!   that allocation and it will still get invalidated if the allocation gets deallocated.
//!   In the future we may introduce an API to make such a forged allocation explicit.
//!
//! * [`wrapping_offset`][] a pointer outside its provenance. This includes invalid pointers
//!   which have "no" provenance. Unfortunately there may be practical limits on this for a
//!   particular platform, and it's an open question as to how to specify this (if at all).
//!   Notably, [CHERI][] relies on a compression scheme that can't handle a
//!   pointer getting offset "too far" out of bounds. If this happens, the address
//!   returned by `addr` will be the value you expect, but the provenance will get invalidated
//!   and using it to read/write will fault. The details of this are architecture-specific
//!   and based on alignment, but the buffer on either side of the pointer's range is pretty
//!   generous (think kilobytes, not bytes).
//!
//! * Compare arbitrary pointers by address. Addresses *are* just integers and so there is
//!   always a coherent answer, even if the pointers are invalid or from different
//!   address-spaces/provenances. Of course, comparing addresses from different address-spaces
//!   is generally going to be *meaningless*, but so is comparing Kilograms to Meters, and CrabLang
//!   doesn't prevent that either. Similarly, if you get "lucky" and notice that a pointer
//!   one-past-the-end is the "same" address as the start of an unrelated allocation, anything
//!   you do with that fact is *probably* going to be gibberish. The scope of that gibberish
//!   is kept under control by the fact that the two pointers *still* aren't allowed to access
//!   the other's allocation (bytes), because they still have different provenance.
//!
//! * Perform pointer tagging tricks. This falls out of [`wrapping_offset`] but is worth
//!   mentioning in more detail because of the limitations of [CHERI][]. Low-bit tagging
//!   is very robust, and often doesn't even go out of bounds because types ensure
//!   size >= align (and over-aligning actually gives CHERI more flexibility). Anything
//!   more complex than this rapidly enters "extremely platform-specific" territory as
//!   certain things may or may not be allowed based on specific supported operations.
//!   For instance, ARM explicitly supports high-bit tagging, and so CHERI on ARM inherits
//!   that and should support it.
//!
//! ## Pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips and 'exposed' provenance
//!
//! **This section is *non-normative* and is part of the [Strict Provenance] experiment.**
//!
//! As discussed above, pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips are not possible under [Strict Provenance].
//! However, there exists legacy CrabLang code that is full of such roundtrips, and legacy platform APIs
//! regularly assume that `usize` can capture all the information that makes up a pointer. There
//! also might be code that cannot be ported to Strict Provenance (which is something we would [like
//! to hear about][Strict Provenance]).
//!
//! For situations like this, there is a fallback plan, a way to 'opt out' of Strict Provenance.
//! However, note that this makes your code a lot harder to specify, and the code will not work
//! (well) with tools like [Miri] and [CHERI].
//!
//! This fallback plan is provided by the [`expose_addr`] and [`from_exposed_addr`] methods (which
//! are equivalent to `as` casts between pointers and integers). [`expose_addr`] is a lot like
//! [`addr`], but additionally adds the provenance of the pointer to a global list of 'exposed'
//! provenances. (This list is purely conceptual, it exists for the purpose of specifying CrabLang but
//! is not materialized in actual executions, except in tools like [Miri].) [`from_exposed_addr`]
//! can be used to construct a pointer with one of these previously 'exposed' provenances.
//! [`from_exposed_addr`] takes only `addr: usize` as arguments, so unlike in [`with_addr`] there is
//! no indication of what the correct provenance for the returned pointer is -- and that is exactly
//! what makes pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips so tricky to rigorously specify! There is no
//! algorithm that decides which provenance will be used. You can think of this as "guessing" the
//! right provenance, and the guess will be "maximally in your favor", in the sense that if there is
//! any way to avoid undefined behavior, then that is the guess that will be taken. However, if
//! there is *no* previously 'exposed' provenance that justifies the way the returned pointer will
//! be used, the program has undefined behavior.
//!
//! Using [`expose_addr`] or [`from_exposed_addr`] (or the equivalent `as` casts) means that code is
//! *not* following Strict Provenance rules. The goal of the Strict Provenance experiment is to
//! determine whether it is possible to use CrabLang without [`expose_addr`] and [`from_exposed_addr`].
//! If this is successful, it would be a major win for avoiding specification complexity and to
//! facilitate adoption of tools like [CHERI] and [Miri] that can be a big help in increasing the
//! confidence in (unsafe) CrabLang code.

    // provides enough information to know that this is a typed operation.

    // However, as of March 2023 the compiler was not capable of taking advantage
    // of that information.  Thus the implementation here switched to an intrinsic,
    // which lowers to `_0 = *src` in MIR, to address a few issues:
    //
    // - Using `MaybeUninit::assume_init` after a `copy_nonoverlapping` was not
    //   turning the untyped copy into a typed load. As such, the generated
    //   `load` in LLVM didn't get various metadata, such as `!range` (#73258),
    //   `!nonnull`, and `!noundef`, resulting in poorer optimization.
    // - Going through the extra local resulted in multiple extra copies, even
    //   in optimized MIR.  (Ignoring StorageLive/Dead, the intrinsic is one
    //   MIR statement, while the previous implementation was eight.)  LLVM
    //   could sometimes optimize them away, but because `read` is at the core
    //   of so many things, not having them in the first place improves what we
    //   hand off to the backend.  For example, `mem::replace::<Big>` previously
    //   emitted 4 `alloca` and 6 `memcpy`s, but is now 1 `alloc` and 3 `memcpy`s.
    // - In general, this approach keeps us from getting any more bugs (like
    //   #106369) that boil down to "`read(p)` is worse than `*p`", as this
    //   makes them look identical to the backend (or other MIR consumers).
    //
    // Future enhancements to MIR optimizations might well allow this to return
    // to the previous implementation, rather than using an intrinsic.
