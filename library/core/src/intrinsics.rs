//! Compiler intrinsics.
//!
//! The corresponding definitions are in <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/intrinsic.rs>.
//! The corresponding const implementations are in <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/intrinsics.rs>.
//!
//! # Const intrinsics
//!
//! Note: any changes to the constness of intrinsics should be discussed with the language team.
//! This includes changes in the stability of the constness.
//!
//! In order to make an intrinsic usable at compile-time, one needs to copy the implementation
//! from <https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/blob/master/src/shims/intrinsics.rs> to
//! <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/intrinsics.rs> and add a
//! `#[rustc_const_unstable(feature = "const_such_and_such", issue = "01234")]` to the intrinsic declaration.
//!
//! If an intrinsic is supposed to be used from a `const fn` with a `rustc_const_stable` attribute,
//! the intrinsic's attribute must be `rustc_const_stable`, too. Such a change should not be done
//! without T-lang consultation, because it bakes a feature into the language that cannot be
//! replicated in user code without compiler support.
//!
//! # Volatiles
//!
//! The volatile intrinsics provide operations intended to act on I/O
//! memory, which are guaranteed to not be reordered by the compiler
//! across other volatile intrinsics. See the LLVM documentation on
//! [[volatile]].
//!
//! [volatile]: https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#volatile-memory-accesses
//!
//! # Atomics
//!
//! The atomic intrinsics provide common atomic operations on machine
//! words, with multiple possible memory orderings. They obey the same
//! semantics as C++11. See the LLVM documentation on [[atomics]].
//!
//! [atomics]: https://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html
//!
//! A quick refresher on memory ordering:
//!
//! * Acquire - a barrier for acquiring a lock. Subsequent reads and writes
//!   take place after the barrier.
//! * Release - a barrier for releasing a lock. Preceding reads and writes
//!   take place before the barrier.
//! * Sequentially consistent - sequentially consistent operations are
//!   guaranteed to happen in order. This is the standard mode for working
//!   with atomic types and is equivalent to Java's `volatile`.
