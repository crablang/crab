/// The boolean type.
///
/// The `bool` represents a value, which could only be either [`true`] or [`false`]. If you cast
/// a `bool` into an integer, [`true`] will be 1 and [`false`] will be 0.
///
/// # Basic usage
///
/// `bool` implements various traits, such as [`BitAnd`], [`BitOr`], [`Not`], etc.,
/// which allow us to perform boolean operations using `&`, `|` and `!`.
///
/// [`if`] requires a `bool` value as its conditional. [`assert!`], which is an
/// important macro in testing, checks whether an expression is [`true`] and panics
/// if it isn't.
///
/// ```
/// let bool_val = true & false | false;
/// assert!(!bool_val);
/// ```
///
/// [`true`]: ../std/keyword.true.html
/// [`false`]: ../std/keyword.false.html
/// [`BitAnd`]: ops::BitAnd
/// [`BitOr`]: ops::BitOr
/// [`Not`]: ops::Not
/// [`if`]: ../std/keyword.if.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A trivial example of the usage of `bool`:
///
/// ```
/// let praise_the_borrow_checker = true;
///
/// // using the `if` conditional
/// if praise_the_borrow_checker {
///     println!("oh, yeah!");
/// } else {
///     println!("what?!!");
/// }
///
/// // ... or, a match pattern
/// match praise_the_borrow_checker {
///     true => println!("keep praising!"),
///     false => println!("you should praise!"),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Also, since `bool` implements the [`Copy`] trait, we don't
/// have to worry about the move semantics (just like the integer and float primitives).
///
/// Now an example of `bool` cast to integer type:
///
/// ```
/// assert_eq!(true as i32, 1);
/// assert_eq!(false as i32, 0);

/// The `!` type, also called "never".
///
/// `!` represents the type of computations which never resolve to any value at all. For example,
/// the [`exit`] function `fn exit(code: i32) -> !` exits the process without ever returning, and
/// so returns `!`.
///
/// `break`, `continue` and `return` expressions also have type `!`. For example we are allowed to

///
/// ```
/// #![feature(never_type)]
/// # fn foo() -> u32 {
/// let x: ! = {
///     return 123
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Although the `let` is pointless here, it illustrates the meaning of `!`. Since `x` is never
/// assigned a value (because `return` returns from the entire function), `x` can be given type
/// `!`. We could also replace `return 123` with a `panic!` or a never-ending `loop` and this code

///
/// A more realistic usage of `!` is in this code:

/// ```
/// # fn get_a_number() -> Option<u32> { None }
/// # loop {
/// let num: u32 = match get_a_number() {
///     Some(num) => num,
///     None => break,
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Both match arms must produce values of type [`u32`], but since `break` never produces a value
/// at all we know it can never produce a value which isn't a [`u32`]. This illustrates another

///
/// # `!` and generics
///
/// ## Infallible errors
///
/// The main place you'll see `!` used explicitly is in generic code. Consider the [`FromStr`]
/// trait:
///
/// ```
/// trait FromStr: Sized {
///     type Err;
///     fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err>;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When implementing this trait for [`String`] we need to pick a type for [`Err`]. And since
/// converting a string into a string will never result in an error, the appropriate type is `!`.
/// (Currently the type actually used is an enum with no variants, though this is only because `!`
/// was added to CrabLang at a later date and it may change in the future.) With an [`Err`] type of
/// `!`, if we have to call [`String::from_str`] for some reason the result will be a
/// [`Result<String, !>`] which we can unpack like this:
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(exhaustive_patterns)]
/// use std::str::FromStr;
/// let Ok(s) = String::from_str("hello");
/// ```
///
/// Since the [`Err`] variant contains a `!`, it can never occur. If the `exhaustive_patterns`
/// feature is present this means we can exhaustively match on [`Result<T, !>`] by just taking the
/// [`Ok`] variant. This illustrates another behaviour of `!` - it can be used to "delete" certain
/// enum variants from generic types like `Result`.
///
/// ## Infinite loops
///
/// While [`Result<T, !>`] is very useful for removing errors, `!` can also be used to remove
/// successes as well. If we think of [`Result<T, !>`] as "if this function returns, it has not
/// errored," we get a very intuitive idea of [`Result<!, E>`] as well: if the function returns, it
/// *has* errored.
///
/// For example, consider the case of a simple web server, which can be simplified to:
///
/// ```ignore (hypothetical-example)
/// loop {
///     let (client, request) = get_request().expect("disconnected");
///     let response = request.process();
///     response.send(client);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Currently, this isn't ideal, because we simply panic whenever we fail to get a new connection.
/// Instead, we'd like to keep track of this error, like this:
///
/// ```ignore (hypothetical-example)
/// loop {
///     match get_request() {
///         Err(err) => break err,
///         Ok((client, request)) => {
///             let response = request.process();
///             response.send(client);
///         },
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, when the server disconnects, we exit the loop with an error instead of panicking. While it
/// might be intuitive to simply return the error, we might want to wrap it in a [`Result<!, E>`]
/// instead:
///
/// ```ignore (hypothetical-example)
/// fn server_loop() -> Result<!, ConnectionError> {
///     loop {
///         let (client, request) = get_request()?;
///         let response = request.process();
///         response.send(client);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, we can use `?` instead of `match`, and the return type makes a lot more sense: if the loop
/// ever stops, it means that an error occurred. We don't even have to wrap the loop in an `Ok`
/// because `!` coerces to `Result<!, ConnectionError>` automatically.
///

///
/// # `!` and traits
///
/// When writing your own traits, `!` should have an `impl` whenever there is an obvious `impl`
/// which doesn't `panic!`. The reason is that functions returning an `impl Trait` where `!`
/// does not have an `impl` of `Trait` cannot diverge as their only possible code path. In other
/// words, they can't return `!` from every code path. As an example, this code doesn't compile:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use std::ops::Add;
///
/// fn foo() -> impl Add<u32> {
///     unimplemented!()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// But this code does:
///
/// ```
/// use std::ops::Add;
///
/// fn foo() -> impl Add<u32> {
///     if true {
///         unimplemented!()
///     } else {
///         0
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The reason is that, in the first example, there are many possible types that `!` could coerce
/// to, because many types implement `Add<u32>`. However, in the second example,
/// the `else` branch returns a `0`, which the compiler infers from the return type to be of type
/// `u32`. Since `u32` is a concrete type, `!` can and will be coerced to it. See issue [#36375]
/// for more information on this quirk of `!`.
///
/// [#36375]: https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/36375
///
/// As it turns out, though, most traits can have an `impl` for `!`. Take [`Debug`]
/// for example:
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(never_type)]
/// # use std::fmt;
/// # trait Debug {
/// #     fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result;
/// # }
/// impl Debug for ! {
///     fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
///         *self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Once again we're using `!`'s ability to coerce into any other type, in this case
/// [`fmt::Result`]. Since this method takes a `&!` as an argument we know that it can never be
/// called (because there is no value of type `!` for it to be called with). Writing `*self`
/// essentially tells the compiler "We know that this code can never be run, so just treat the
/// entire function body as having type [`fmt::Result`]". This pattern can be used a lot when
/// implementing traits for `!`. Generally, any trait which only has methods which take a `self`
/// parameter should have such an impl.
///
/// On the other hand, one trait which would not be appropriate to implement is [`Default`]:
///
/// ```
/// trait Default {
///     fn default() -> Self;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since `!` has no values, it has no default value either. It's true that we could write an
/// `impl` for this which simply panics, but the same is true for any type (we could `impl
/// Default` for (eg.) [`File`] by just making [`default()`] panic.)

/// # Validity
///
/// A `char` is a '[Unicode scalar value]', which is any '[Unicode code point]'

///
/// USVs are also the exact set of values that may be encoded in UTF-8. Because
/// `char` values are USVs and `str` values are valid UTF-8, it is safe to store
/// any `char` in a `str` or read any character from a `str` as a `char`.
///
/// The gap in valid `char` values is understood by the compiler, so in the

/// ```
///
#[doc = concat!("[`String`]: ", include_str!("../primitive_docs/string_string.md"))]
///
/// As always, remember that a human intuition for 'character' might not map to
/// Unicode's definitions. For example, despite looking similar, the 'é'
/// character is one Unicode code point while 'é' is two Unicode code points:
///
/// ```
/// let mut chars = "é".chars();
/// // U+00e9: 'latin small letter e with acute'

/// // U+0301: 'combining acute accent'
/// assert_eq!(Some('\u{0301}'), chars.next());
/// assert_eq!(None, chars.next());
/// ```
///
/// This means that the contents of the first string above _will_ fit into a

/// Working with raw pointers in CrabLang is uncommon, typically limited to a few patterns.
/// Raw pointers can be unaligned or [`null`]. However, when a raw pointer is
/// dereferenced (using the `*` operator), it must be non-null and aligned.
///
/// Storing through a raw pointer using `*ptr = data` calls `drop` on the old value, so
/// [`write`] must be used if the type has drop glue and memory is not already
/// initialized - otherwise `drop` would be called on the uninitialized memory.
///
/// Use the [`null`] and [`null_mut`] functions to create null pointers, and the
/// [`is_null`] method of the `*const T` and `*mut T` types to check for null.
/// The `*const T` and `*mut T` types also define the [`offset`] method, for
/// pointer math.
///
/// # Common ways to create raw pointers
///
/// ## 1. Coerce a reference (`&T`) or mutable reference (`&mut T`).
///
/// ```
/// let my_num: i32 = 10;
/// let my_num_ptr: *const i32 = &my_num;
/// let mut my_speed: i32 = 88;
/// let my_speed_ptr: *mut i32 = &mut my_speed;
/// ```
///
/// To get a pointer to a boxed value, dereference the box:
///
/// ```
/// let my_num: Box<i32> = Box::new(10);
/// let my_num_ptr: *const i32 = &*my_num;
/// let mut my_speed: Box<i32> = Box::new(88);
/// let my_speed_ptr: *mut i32 = &mut *my_speed;
/// ```
///
/// This does not take ownership of the original allocation
/// and requires no resource management later,
/// but you must not use the pointer after its lifetime.
///
/// ## 2. Consume a box (`Box<T>`).
///
/// The [`into_raw`] function consumes a box and returns
/// the raw pointer. It doesn't destroy `T` or deallocate any memory.
///
/// ```
/// let my_speed: Box<i32> = Box::new(88);
/// let my_speed: *mut i32 = Box::into_raw(my_speed);
///
/// // By taking ownership of the original `Box<T>` though
/// // we are obligated to put it together later to be destroyed.
/// unsafe {
///     drop(Box::from_raw(my_speed));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that here the call to [`drop`] is for clarity - it indicates
/// that we are done with the given value and it should be destroyed.
///
/// ## 3. Create it using `ptr::addr_of!`
///
/// Instead of coercing a reference to a raw pointer, you can use the macros
/// [`ptr::addr_of!`] (for `*const T`) and [`ptr::addr_of_mut!`] (for `*mut T`).
/// These macros allow you to create raw pointers to fields to which you cannot
/// create a reference (without causing undefined behaviour), such as an
/// unaligned field. This might be necessary if packed structs or uninitialized
/// memory is involved.
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Debug, Default, Copy, Clone)]
/// #[repr(C, packed)]
/// struct S {
///     aligned: u8,
///     unaligned: u32,
/// }
/// let s = S::default();
/// let p = std::ptr::addr_of!(s.unaligned); // not allowed with coercion

///

/// `array.into_iter()` auto-referenced into a [slice iterator](slice::iter). Right now, the old
/// behavior is preserved in the 2015 and 2018 editions of CrabLang for compatibility, ignoring
/// [`IntoIterator`] by value. In the future, the behavior on the 2015 and 2018 edition
/// might be made consistent to the behavior of later editions.
///
/// ```crablang,edition2018
/// // CrabLang 2015 and 2018:
///
/// # #![allow(array_into_iter)] // override our `deny(warnings)`
/// let array: [i32; 3] = [0; 3];
///
/// // This creates a slice iterator, producing references to each value.
/// for item in array.into_iter().enumerate() {
///     let (i, x): (usize, &i32) = item;
///     println!("array[{i}] = {x}");
/// }
///
/// // The `array_into_iter` lint suggests this change for future compatibility:
/// for item in array.iter().enumerate() {
///     let (i, x): (usize, &i32) = item;
///     println!("array[{i}] = {x}");
/// }
///
/// // You can explicitly iterate an array by value using `IntoIterator::into_iter`

///     let (i, x): (usize, i32) = item;
///     println!("array[{i}] = {x}");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Starting in the 2021 edition, `array.into_iter()` uses `IntoIterator` normally to iterate
/// by value, and `iter()` should be used to iterate by reference like previous editions.
///
/// ```crablang,edition2021
/// // CrabLang 2021:
///
/// let array: [i32; 3] = [0; 3];

/// ```
///
/// Future language versions might start treating the `array.into_iter()`
/// syntax on editions 2015 and 2018 the same as on edition 2021. So code using

/// This type can represent a wide range of decimal numbers, like `3.5`, `27`,
/// `-113.75`, `0.0078125`, `34359738368`, `0`, `-1`. So unlike integer types
/// (such as `i32`), floating point types can represent non-integer numbers,
/// too.
///
/// However, being able to represent this wide range of numbers comes at the
/// cost of precision: floats can only represent some of the real numbers and
/// calculation with floats round to a nearby representable number. For example,
/// `5.0` and `1.0` can be exactly represented as `f32`, but `1.0 / 5.0` results
/// in `0.20000000298023223876953125` since `0.2` cannot be exactly represented
/// as `f32`. Note, however, that printing floats with `println` and friends will
/// often discard insignificant digits: `println!("{}", 1.0f32 / 5.0f32)` will
/// print `0.2`.
///
/// Additionally, `f32` can represent some special values:
///
/// - −0.0: IEEE 754 floating point numbers have a bit that indicates their sign, so −0.0 is a
///   possible value. For comparison −0.0 = +0.0, but floating point operations can carry
///   the sign bit through arithmetic operations. This means −0.0 × +0.0 produces −0.0 and
///   a negative number rounded to a value smaller than a float can represent also produces −0.0.
/// - [∞](#associatedconstant.INFINITY) and
///   [−∞](#associatedconstant.NEG_INFINITY): these result from calculations
///   like `1.0 / 0.0`.
/// - [NaN (not a number)](#associatedconstant.NAN): this value results from
///   calculations like `(-1.0).sqrt()`. NaN has some potentially unexpected
///   behavior:
///   - It is not equal to any float, including itself! This is the reason `f32`
///     doesn't implement the `Eq` trait.
///   - It is also neither smaller nor greater than any float, making it
///     impossible to sort by the default comparison operation, which is the
///     reason `f32` doesn't implement the `Ord` trait.
///   - It is also considered *infectious* as almost all calculations where one
///     of the operands is NaN will also result in NaN. The explanations on this
///     page only explicitly document behavior on NaN operands if this default
///     is deviated from.
///   - Lastly, there are multiple bit patterns that are considered NaN.
///     CrabLang does not currently guarantee that the bit patterns of NaN are
///     preserved over arithmetic operations, and they are not guaranteed to be
///     portable or even fully deterministic! This means that there may be some
///     surprising results upon inspecting the bit patterns,
///     as the same calculations might produce NaNs with different bit patterns.
///
/// When the number resulting from a primitive operation (addition,
/// subtraction, multiplication, or division) on this type is not exactly
/// representable as `f32`, it is rounded according to the roundTiesToEven
/// direction defined in IEEE 754-2008. That means:
///
/// - The result is the representable value closest to the true value, if there
///   is a unique closest representable value.
/// - If the true value is exactly half-way between two representable values,
///   the result is the one with an even least-significant binary digit.
/// - If the true value's magnitude is ≥ `f32::MAX` + 2<sup>(`f32::MAX_EXP` −
///   `f32::MANTISSA_DIGITS` − 1)</sup>, the result is ∞ or −∞ (preserving the

/// Function pointers are pointers that point to *code*, not data. They can be called
/// just like functions. Like references, function pointers are, among other things, assumed to
/// not be null, so if you want to pass a function pointer over FFI and be able to accommodate null
/// pointers, make your type [`Option<fn()>`](core::option#options-and-pointers-nullable-pointers)
/// with your required signature.
///
/// ### Safety
///
/// Plain function pointers are obtained by casting either plain functions, or closures that don't
/// capture an environment:
///
/// ```
/// fn add_one(x: usize) -> usize {
///     x + 1
/// }
///
/// let ptr: fn(usize) -> usize = add_one;
/// assert_eq!(ptr(5), 6);
///
/// let clos: fn(usize) -> usize = |x| x + 5;
/// assert_eq!(clos(5), 10);
/// ```
///
/// In addition to varying based on their signature, function pointers come in two flavors: safe
/// and unsafe. Plain `fn()` function pointers can only point to safe functions,
/// while `unsafe fn()` function pointers can point to safe or unsafe functions.
///
/// ```
/// fn add_one(x: usize) -> usize {
///     x + 1
/// }
///
/// unsafe fn add_one_unsafely(x: usize) -> usize {
///     x + 1
/// }
///
/// let safe_ptr: fn(usize) -> usize = add_one;
///
/// //ERROR: mismatched types: expected normal fn, found unsafe fn
/// //let bad_ptr: fn(usize) -> usize = add_one_unsafely;
///
/// let unsafe_ptr: unsafe fn(usize) -> usize = add_one_unsafely;
/// let really_safe_ptr: unsafe fn(usize) -> usize = add_one;
/// ```
///
/// ### ABI
///
/// On top of that, function pointers can vary based on what ABI they use. This
/// is achieved by adding the `extern` keyword before the type, followed by the
/// ABI in question. The default ABI is "CrabLang", i.e., `fn()` is the exact same
/// type as `extern "CrabLang" fn()`. A pointer to a function with C ABI would have
/// type `extern "C" fn()`.
///
/// `extern "ABI" { ... }` blocks declare functions with ABI "ABI". The default
/// here is "C", i.e., functions declared in an `extern {...}` block have "C"
/// ABI.
///
/// For more information and a list of supported ABIs, see [the nomicon's
/// section on foreign calling conventions][nomicon-abi].
///
/// [nomicon-abi]: ../nomicon/ffi.html#foreign-calling-conventions
///
/// ### Variadic functions
///
/// Extern function declarations with the "C" or "cdecl" ABIs can also be *variadic*, allowing them
/// to be called with a variable number of arguments. Normal CrabLang functions, even those with an
/// `extern "ABI"`, cannot be variadic. For more information, see [the nomicon's section on
/// variadic functions][nomicon-variadic].
///
/// [nomicon-variadic]: ../nomicon/ffi.html#variadic-functions
///
/// ### Creating function pointers
///
/// When `bar` is the name of a function, then the expression `bar` is *not* a
/// function pointer. Rather, it denotes a value of an unnameable type that
/// uniquely identifies the function `bar`. The value is zero-sized because the
/// type already identifies the function. This has the advantage that "calling"
/// the value (it implements the `Fn*` traits) does not require dynamic
/// dispatch.
///
/// This zero-sized type *coerces* to a regular function pointer. For example:
///
/// ```crablang
/// use std::mem;
///
/// fn bar(x: i32) {}
///
/// let not_bar_ptr = bar; // `not_bar_ptr` is zero-sized, uniquely identifying `bar`
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of_val(&not_bar_ptr), 0);
///
/// let bar_ptr: fn(i32) = not_bar_ptr; // force coercion to function pointer
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of_val(&bar_ptr), mem::size_of::<usize>());
///
/// let footgun = &bar; // this is a shared reference to the zero-sized type identifying `bar`
/// ```
///
/// The last line shows that `&bar` is not a function pointer either. Rather, it
/// is a reference to the function-specific ZST. `&bar` is basically never what you
/// want when `bar` is a function.
///
/// ### Casting to and from integers
///
/// You cast function pointers directly to integers:
///
/// ```crablang
/// let fnptr: fn(i32) -> i32 = |x| x+2;
/// let fnptr_addr = fnptr as usize;
/// ```
///
/// However, a direct cast back is not possible. You need to use `transmute`:
///
/// ```crablang
/// # #[cfg(not(miri))] { // FIXME: use strict provenance APIs once they are stable, then remove this `cfg`
/// # let fnptr: fn(i32) -> i32 = |x| x+2;
/// # let fnptr_addr = fnptr as usize;
/// let fnptr = fnptr_addr as *const ();
/// let fnptr: fn(i32) -> i32 = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(fnptr) };
/// assert_eq!(fnptr(40), 42);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Crucially, we `as`-cast to a raw pointer before `transmute`ing to a function pointer.
/// This avoids an integer-to-pointer `transmute`, which can be problematic.
/// Transmuting between raw pointers and function pointers (i.e., two pointer types) is fine.
///
/// Note that all of this is not portable to platforms where function pointers and data pointers
/// have different sizes.
///
/// ### Trait implementations
///
/// In this documentation the shorthand `fn (T₁, T₂, …, Tₙ)` is used to represent non-variadic
/// function pointers of varying length. Note that this is a convenience notation to avoid
/// repetitive documentation, not valid CrabLang syntax.
///
/// Due to a temporary restriction in CrabLang's type system, these traits are only implemented on
/// functions that take 12 arguments or less, with the `"CrabLang"` and `"C"` ABIs. In the future, this
/// may change:
///
/// * [`PartialEq`]
/// * [`Eq`]
/// * [`PartialOrd`]
/// * [`Ord`]
/// * [`Hash`]
/// * [`Pointer`]
/// * [`Debug`]
///
/// The following traits are implemented for function pointers with any number of arguments and
/// any ABI. These traits have implementations that are automatically generated by the compiler,
/// so are not limited by missing language features:
///
/// * [`Clone`]
/// * [`Copy`]
/// * [`Send`]
/// * [`Sync`]
/// * [`Unpin`]
/// * [`UnwindSafe`]
/// * [`RefUnwindSafe`]
///
/// [`Hash`]: hash::Hash
/// [`Pointer`]: fmt::Pointer
/// [`UnwindSafe`]: panic::UnwindSafe
/// [`RefUnwindSafe`]: panic::RefUnwindSafe
///
/// In addition, all *safe* function pointers implement [`Fn`], [`FnMut`], and [`FnOnce`], because
/// these traits are specially known to the compiler.
