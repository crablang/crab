/// This function will return `Ok` with the closure's result if the closure
/// does not panic, and will return `Err(cause)` if the closure panics. The
/// `cause` returned is the object with which panic was originally invoked.
///
/// It is currently undefined behavior to unwind from CrabLang code into foreign
/// code, so this function is particularly useful when CrabLang is called from
/// another language (normally C). This can run arbitrary CrabLang code, capturing a
/// panic and allowing a graceful handling of the error.
///
/// It is **not** recommended to use this function for a general try/catch
/// mechanism. The [`Result`] type is more appropriate to use for functions that
/// can fail on a regular basis. Additionally, this function is not guaranteed
/// to catch all panics, see the "Notes" section below.
///
/// The closure provided is required to adhere to the [`UnwindSafe`] trait to ensure
/// that all captured variables are safe to cross this boundary. The purpose of
/// this bound is to encode the concept of [exception safety][rfc] in the type
/// system. Most usage of this function should not need to worry about this
/// bound as programs are naturally unwind safe without `unsafe` code. If it
/// becomes a problem the [`AssertUnwindSafe`] wrapper struct can be used to quickly
/// assert that the usage here is indeed unwind safe.
///
/// [rfc]: https://github.com/crablang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md
///
/// # Notes
///
/// Note that this function **might not catch all panics** in CrabLang. A panic in
/// CrabLang is not always implemented via unwinding, but can be implemented by
/// aborting the process as well. This function *only* catches unwinding panics,
/// not those that abort the process.
///
/// Note that if a custom panic hook has been set, it will be invoked before
/// the panic is caught, before unwinding.
///
/// Also note that unwinding into CrabLang code with a foreign exception (e.g.
/// an exception thrown from C++ code) is undefined behavior.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::panic;
///
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
///     println!("hello!");
/// });
/// assert!(result.is_ok());
///
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
///     panic!("oh no!");
/// });
/// assert!(result.is_err());
/// ```

///
/// This is designed to be used in conjunction with [`catch_unwind`] to, for
/// example, carry a panic across a layer of C code.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// Note that panics in CrabLang are not always implemented via unwinding, but they
/// may be implemented by aborting the process. If this function is called when
/// panics are implemented this way then this function will abort the process,
/// not trigger an unwind.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```should_panic
/// use std::panic;
///
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
///     panic!("oh no!");
/// });
///
/// if let Err(err) = result {

/// Make all future panics abort directly without running the panic hook or unwinding.
///
/// There is no way to undo this; the effect lasts until the process exits or
/// execs (or the equivalent).
///
/// # Use after fork
///
/// This function is particularly useful for calling after `libc::fork`.  After `fork`, in a
/// multithreaded program it is (on many platforms) not safe to call the allocator.  It is also
/// generally highly undesirable for an unwind to unwind past the `fork`, because that results in
/// the unwind propagating to code that was only ever expecting to run in the parent.
///
/// `panic::always_abort()` helps avoid both of these.  It directly avoids any further unwinding,
/// and if there is a panic, the abort will occur without allocating provided that the arguments to
/// panic can be formatted without allocating.
///
/// Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// #![feature(panic_always_abort)]
/// use std::panic;
///
/// panic::always_abort();
///
/// let _ = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
///     panic!("inside the catch");
