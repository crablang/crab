//! Inspection and manipulation of the process's environment.
//!
//! This module contains functions to inspect various aspects such as
//! environment variables, process arguments, the current directory, and various
//! other important directories.
//!
//! There are several functions and structs in this module that have a
//! counterpart ending in `os`. Those ending in `os` will return an [`OsString`]
//! and those without will return a [`String`].
