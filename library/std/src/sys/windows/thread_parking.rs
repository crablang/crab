// Thread parker implementation for Windows.
//
// This uses WaitOnAddress and WakeByAddressSingle if available (Windows 8+).
// This modern API is exactly the same as the futex syscalls the Linux thread
// parker uses. When These APIs are available, the implementation of this
// thread parker matches the Linux thread parker exactly.
//
// However, when the modern API is not available, this implementation falls
// back to NT Keyed Events, which are similar, but have some important
// differences. These are available since Windows XP.
//
// WaitOnAddress first checks the state of the thread parker to make sure it no
// WakeByAddressSingle calls can be missed between updating the parker state
// and calling the function.
//
// NtWaitForKeyedEvent does not have this option, and unconditionally blocks
// without checking the parker state first. Instead, NtReleaseKeyedEvent
// (unlike WakeByAddressSingle) *blocks* until it woke up a thread waiting for
// it by NtWaitForKeyedEvent. This way, we can be sure no events are missed,
// but we need to be careful not to block unpark() if park_timeout() was woken
// up by a timeout instead of unpark().
//
// Unlike WaitOnAddress, NtWaitForKeyedEvent/NtReleaseKeyedEvent operate on a
// HANDLE (created with NtCreateKeyedEvent). This means that we can be sure
// a successfully awoken park() was awoken by unpark() and not a
// NtReleaseKeyedEvent call from some other code, as these events are not only
// matched by the key (address of the parker (state)), but also by this HANDLE.
// We lazily allocate this handle the first time it is needed.
//
// The fast path (calling park() after unpark() was already called) and the
// possible states are the same for both implementations. This is used here to
// make sure the fast path does not even check which API to use, but can return
// right away, independent of the used API. Only the slow paths (which will
// actually block/wake a thread) check which API is available and have
// different implementations.
//
// Unfortunately, NT Keyed Events are an undocumented Windows API. However:
// - This API is relatively simple with obvious behaviour, and there are
//   several (unofficial) articles documenting the details. [1]
// - `parking_lot` has been using this API for years (on Windows versions
//   before Windows 8). [2] Many big projects extensively use parking_lot,
//   such as servo and the CrabLang compiler itself.
// - It is the underlying API used by Windows SRW locks and Windows critical
//   sections. [3] [4]
// - The source code of the implementations of Wine, ReactOs, and Windows XP
//   are available and match the expected behaviour.
// - The main risk with an undocumented API is that it might change in the
//   future. But since we only use it for older versions of Windows, that's not
//   a problem.
// - Even if these functions do not block or wake as we expect (which is
//   unlikely, see all previous points), this implementation would still be
//   memory safe. The NT Keyed Events API is only used to sleep/block in the
//   right place.

// Notes about memory ordering:
//
// Memory ordering is only relevant for the relative ordering of operations
// between different variables. Even Ordering::Relaxed guarantees a
// monotonic/consistent order when looking at just a single atomic variable.
//
// So, since this parker is just a single atomic variable, we only need to look
// at the ordering guarantees we need to provide to the 'outside world'.
//
// The only memory ordering guarantee that parking and unparking provide, is
// that things which happened before unpark() are visible on the thread
// returning from park() afterwards. Otherwise, it was effectively unparked
// before unpark() was called while still consuming the 'token'.
//
// In other words, unpark() needs to synchronize with the part of park() that
// consumes the token and returns.
//
// This is done with a release-acquire synchronization, by using
// Ordering::Release when writing NOTIFIED (the 'token') in unpark(), and using
// Ordering::Acquire when reading this state in park() after waking up.
