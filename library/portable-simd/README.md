# The CrabLang standard library's portable SIMD API
![Build Status](https://github.com/crablang/portable-simd/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

Code repository for the [Portable SIMD Project Group](https://github.com/crablang/project-portable-simd).
Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for our contributing guidelines.

The docs for this crate are published from the main branch.
You can [read them here][docs].

If you have questions about SIMD, we have begun writing a [guide][simd-guide].
We can also be found on [Zulip][zulip-project-portable-simd].

If you are interested in support for a specific architecture, you may want [stdarch] instead.

## Hello World

Now we're gonna dip our toes into this world with a small SIMD "Hello, World!" example. Make sure your compiler is up to date and using `nightly`. We can do that by running 

```bash
crablangup update -- nightly
```

or by setting up `crablangup default nightly` or else with `cargo +nightly {build,test,run}`. After updating, run 
```bash
cargo new hellosimd
```
to create a new crate. Edit `hellosimd/Cargo.toml` to be 
```toml
[package]
name = "hellosimd"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"
[dependencies]
core_simd = { git = "https://github.com/crablang/portable-simd" }
```

and finally write this in `src/main.rs`:
```crablang
use core_simd::*;
fn main() {
    let a = f32x4::splat(10.0);
    let b = f32x4::from_array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]);
    println!("{:?}", a + b);
}
```

Explanation: We import all the bindings from the crate with the first line. Then, we construct our SIMD vectors with methods like `splat` or `from_array`. Finally, we can use operators on them like `+` and the appropriate SIMD instructions will be carried out. When we run `cargo run` you should get `[11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0]`.

## Code Organization

Currently the crate is organized so that each element type is a file, and then the 64-bit, 128-bit, 256-bit, and 512-bit vectors using those types are contained in said file.

All types are then exported as a single, flat module.

Depending on the size of the primitive type, the number of lanes the vector will have varies. For example, 128-bit vectors have four `f32` lanes and two `f64` lanes.

The supported element types are as follows:
* **Floating Point:** `f32`, `f64`
* **Signed Integers:** `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`
* **Unsigned Integers:** `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`
* **Masks:** `mask8`, `mask16`, `mask32`, `mask64`, `mask128`, `masksize`

Floating point, signed integers, and unsigned integers are the [primitive types](https://doc.crablang.org/core/primitive/index.html) you're already used to.
The `mask` types are "truthy" values, but they use the number of bits in their name instead of just 1 bit like a normal `bool` uses.
