//! Windows SEH
//!
//! On Windows (currently only on MSVC), the default exception handling
//! mechanism is Structured Exception Handling (SEH). This is quite different
//! than Dwarf-based exception handling (e.g., what other unix platforms use) in
//! terms of compiler internals, so LLVM is required to have a good deal of
//! extra support for SEH.
//!
//! In a nutshell, what happens here is:
//!
//! 1. The `panic` function calls the standard Windows function
//!    `_CxxThrowException` to throw a C++-like exception, triggering the
//!    unwinding process.
//! 2. All landing pads generated by the compiler use the personality function
//!    `__CxxFrameHandler3`, a function in the CRT, and the unwinding code in
//!    Windows will use this personality function to execute all cleanup code on
//!    the stack.
//! 3. All compiler-generated calls to `invoke` have a landing pad set as a
//!    `cleanuppad` LLVM instruction, which indicates the start of the cleanup
//!    routine. The personality (in step 2, defined in the CRT) is responsible
//!    for running the cleanup routines.
//! 4. Eventually the "catch" code in the `try` intrinsic (generated by the
//!    compiler) is executed and indicates that control should come back to
//!    CrabLang. This is done via a `catchswitch` plus a `catchpad` instruction in
//!    LLVM IR terms, finally returning normal control to the program with a
//!    `catchret` instruction.
//!
//! Some specific differences from the gcc-based exception handling are:
//!
//! * CrabLang has no custom personality function, it is instead *always*
//!   `__CxxFrameHandler3`. Additionally, no extra filtering is performed, so we
//!   end up catching any C++ exceptions that happen to look like the kind we're
//!   throwing. Note that throwing an exception into CrabLang is undefined behavior
//!   anyway, so this should be fine.
//! * We've got some data to transmit across the unwinding boundary,
//!   specifically a `Box<dyn Any + Send>`. Like with Dwarf exceptions
//!   these two pointers are stored as a payload in the exception itself. On
//!   MSVC, however, there's no need for an extra heap allocation because the
//!   call stack is preserved while filter functions are being executed. This
//!   means that the pointers are passed directly to `_CxxThrowException` which
//!   are then recovered in the filter function to be written to the stack frame
//!   of the `try` intrinsic.

// First up, a whole bunch of type definitions. There's a few platform-specific
// oddities here, and a lot that's just blatantly copied from LLVM. The purpose
// of all this is to implement the `panic` function below through a call to
// `_CxxThrowException`.
//
// This function takes two arguments. The first is a pointer to the data we're
// passing in, which in this case is our trait object. Pretty easy to find! The
// next, however, is more complicated. This is a pointer to a `_ThrowInfo`
// structure, and it generally is just intended to just describe the exception
// being thrown.
//
// Currently the definition of this type [1] is a little hairy, and the main
// oddity (and difference from the online article) is that on 32-bit the
// pointers are pointers but on 64-bit the pointers are expressed as 32-bit
// offsets from the `__ImageBase` symbol. The `ptr_t` and `ptr!` macro in the
// modules below are used to express this.
//
// The maze of type definitions also closely follows what LLVM emits for this
// sort of operation. For example, if you compile this C++ code on MSVC and emit
// the LLVM IR:
//
//      #include <stdint.h>
//
//      struct crablang_panic {
//          crablang_panic(const crablang_panic&);
//          ~crablang_panic();
//
//          uint64_t x[2];
//      };
//
//      void foo() {
//          crablang_panic a = {0, 1};
//          throw a;
//      }
//
// That's essentially what we're trying to emulate. Most of the constant values
// below were just copied from LLVM,
//
// In any case, these structures are all constructed in a similar manner, and
// it's just somewhat verbose for us.
