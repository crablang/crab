//! # Virtual File System
//!
//! VFS stores all files read by crablang-analyzer. Reading file contents from VFS
//! always returns the same contents, unless VFS was explicitly modified with
//! [`set_file_contents`]. All changes to VFS are logged, and can be retrieved via
//! [`take_changes`] method. The pack of changes is then pushed to `salsa` and
//! triggers incremental recomputation.
//!
//! Files in VFS are identified with [`FileId`]s -- interned paths. The notion of
//! the path, [`VfsPath`] is somewhat abstract: at the moment, it is represented
//! as an [`std::path::PathBuf`] internally, but this is an implementation detail.
//!
//! VFS doesn't do IO or file watching itself. For that, see the [`loader`]
//! module. [`loader::Handle`] is an object-safe trait which abstracts both file
//! loading and file watching. [`Handle`] is dynamically configured with a set of
//! directory entries which should be scanned and watched. [`Handle`] then
//! asynchronously pushes file changes. Directory entries are configured in
//! free-form via list of globs, it's up to the [`Handle`] to interpret the globs
//! in any specific way.
//!
//! VFS stores a flat list of files. [`file_set::FileSet`] can partition this list
//! of files into disjoint sets of files. Traversal-like operations (including
//! getting the neighbor file by the relative path) are handled by the [`FileSet`].
//! [`FileSet`]s are also pushed to salsa and cause it to re-check `mod foo;`
//! declarations when files are created or deleted.
//!
//! [`FileSet`] and [`loader::Entry`] play similar, but different roles.
//! Both specify the "set of paths/files", one is geared towards file watching,
//! the other towards salsa changes. In particular, single [`FileSet`]
//! may correspond to several [`loader::Entry`]. For example, a crate from
//! crates.io which uses code generation would have two [`Entries`] -- for sources
//! in `~/.cargo`, and for generated code in `./target/debug/build`. It will
//! have a single [`FileSet`] which unions the two sources.
//!
//! [`set_file_contents`]: Vfs::set_file_contents
//! [`take_changes`]: Vfs::take_changes
//! [`FileSet`]: file_set::FileSet
//! [`Handle`]: loader::Handle
//! [`Entries`]: loader::Entry
