//! -----
//!
//! This file includes the logic for exhaustiveness and reachability checking for pattern-matching.
//! Specifically, given a list of patterns for a type, we can tell whether:
//! (a) each pattern is reachable (reachability)
//! (b) the patterns cover every possible value for the type (exhaustiveness)
//!
//! The algorithm implemented here is a modified version of the one described in [this
//! paper](http://moscova.inria.fr/~maranget/papers/warn/index.html). We have however generalized
//! it to accommodate the variety of patterns that CrabLang supports. We thus explain our version here,
//! without being as rigorous.
//!
//!
//! # Summary
//!
//! The core of the algorithm is the notion of "usefulness". A pattern `q` is said to be *useful*
//! relative to another pattern `p` of the same type if there is a value that is matched by `q` and
//! not matched by `p`. This generalizes to many `p`s: `q` is useful w.r.t. a list of patterns
//! `p_1 .. p_n` if there is a value that is matched by `q` and by none of the `p_i`. We write
//! `usefulness(p_1 .. p_n, q)` for a function that returns a list of such values. The aim of this
//! file is to compute it efficiently.
//!
//! This is enough to compute reachability: a pattern in a `match` expression is reachable iff it
//! is useful w.r.t. the patterns above it:
//! ```crablang
//! match x {
//!     Some(_) => ...,
//!     None => ..., // reachable: `None` is matched by this but not the branch above
//!     Some(0) => ..., // unreachable: all the values this matches are already matched by
//!                     // `Some(_)` above
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is also enough to compute exhaustiveness: a match is exhaustive iff the wildcard `_`
//! pattern is _not_ useful w.r.t. the patterns in the match. The values returned by `usefulness`
//! are used to tell the user which values are missing.
//! ```crablang
//! match x {
//!     Some(0) => ...,
//!     None => ...,
//!     // not exhaustive: `_` is useful because it matches `Some(1)`
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The entrypoint of this file is the [`compute_match_usefulness`] function, which computes
//! reachability for each match branch and exhaustiveness for the whole match.
//!
//!
//! # Constructors and fields
//!
//! Note: we will often abbreviate "constructor" as "ctor".
//!
//! The idea that powers everything that is done in this file is the following: a (matcheable)
//! value is made from a constructor applied to a number of subvalues. Examples of constructors are
//! `Some`, `None`, `(,)` (the 2-tuple constructor), `Foo {..}` (the constructor for a struct
//! `Foo`), and `2` (the constructor for the number `2`). This is natural when we think of
//! pattern-matching, and this is the basis for what follows.
//!
//! Some of the ctors listed above might feel weird: `None` and `2` don't take any arguments.
//! That's ok: those are ctors that take a list of 0 arguments; they are the simplest case of
//! ctors. We treat `2` as a ctor because `u64` and other number types behave exactly like a huge
//! `enum`, with one variant for each number. This allows us to see any matcheable value as made up
//! from a tree of ctors, each having a set number of children. For example: `Foo { bar: None,
//! baz: Ok(0) }` is made from 4 different ctors, namely `Foo{..}`, `None`, `Ok` and `0`.
//!
//! This idea can be extended to patterns: they are also made from constructors applied to fields.
//! A pattern for a given type is allowed to use all the ctors for values of that type (which we
//! call "value constructors"), but there are also pattern-only ctors. The most important one is
//! the wildcard (`_`), and the others are integer ranges (`0..=10`), variable-length slices (`[x,
//! ..]`), and or-patterns (`Ok(0) | Err(_)`). Examples of valid patterns are `42`, `Some(_)`, `Foo
//! { bar: Some(0) | None, baz: _ }`. Note that a binder in a pattern (e.g. `Some(x)`) matches the
//! same values as a wildcard (e.g. `Some(_)`), so we treat both as wildcards.
//!
//! From this deconstruction we can compute whether a given value matches a given pattern; we
//! simply look at ctors one at a time. Given a pattern `p` and a value `v`, we want to compute
//! `matches!(v, p)`. It's mostly straightforward: we compare the head ctors and when they match
//! we compare their fields recursively. A few representative examples:
//!
//! - `matches!(v, _) := true`
//! - `matches!((v0,  v1), (p0,  p1)) := matches!(v0, p0) && matches!(v1, p1)`
//! - `matches!(Foo { bar: v0, baz: v1 }, Foo { bar: p0, baz: p1 }) := matches!(v0, p0) && matches!(v1, p1)`
//! - `matches!(Ok(v0), Ok(p0)) := matches!(v0, p0)`
//! - `matches!(Ok(v0), Err(p0)) := false` (incompatible variants)
//! - `matches!(v, 1..=100) := matches!(v, 1) || ... || matches!(v, 100)`
//! - `matches!([v0], [p0, .., p1]) := false` (incompatible lengths)
//! - `matches!([v0, v1, v2], [p0, .., p1]) := matches!(v0, p0) && matches!(v2, p1)`
//! - `matches!(v, p0 | p1) := matches!(v, p0) || matches!(v, p1)`
//!
//! Constructors, fields and relevant operations are defined in the [`super::deconstruct_pat`] module.
//!
//! Note: this constructors/fields distinction may not straightforwardly apply to every CrabLang type.
//! For example a value of type `Rc<u64>` can't be deconstructed that way, and `&str` has an
//! infinitude of constructors. There are also subtleties with visibility of fields and
//! uninhabitedness and various other things. The constructors idea can be extended to handle most
//! of these subtleties though; caveats are documented where relevant throughout the code.
//!
//! Whether constructors cover each other is computed by [`Constructor::is_covered_by`].
//!
//!
//! # Specialization
//!
//! Recall that we wish to compute `usefulness(p_1 .. p_n, q)`: given a list of patterns `p_1 ..
//! p_n` and a pattern `q`, all of the same type, we want to find a list of values (called
//! "witnesses") that are matched by `q` and by none of the `p_i`. We obviously don't just
//! enumerate all possible values. From the discussion above we see that we can proceed
//! ctor-by-ctor: for each value ctor of the given type, we ask "is there a value that starts with
//! this constructor and matches `q` and none of the `p_i`?". As we saw above, there's a lot we can
//! say from knowing only the first constructor of our candidate value.
//!
//! Let's take the following example:
//! ```
//! match x {
//!     Enum::Variant1(_) => {} // `p1`
//!     Enum::Variant2(None, 0) => {} // `p2`
//!     Enum::Variant2(Some(_), 0) => {} // `q`
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! We can easily see that if our candidate value `v` starts with `Variant1` it will not match `q`.
//! If `v = Variant2(v0, v1)` however, whether or not it matches `p2` and `q` will depend on `v0`
//! and `v1`. In fact, such a `v` will be a witness of usefulness of `q` exactly when the tuple
//! `(v0, v1)` is a witness of usefulness of `q'` in the following reduced match:
//!
//! ```
//! match x {
//!     (None, 0) => {} // `p2'`
//!     (Some(_), 0) => {} // `q'`
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This motivates a new step in computing usefulness, that we call _specialization_.
//! Specialization consist of filtering a list of patterns for those that match a constructor, and
//! then looking into the constructor's fields. This enables usefulness to be computed recursively.
//!
//! Instead of acting on a single pattern in each row, we will consider a list of patterns for each
//! row, and we call such a list a _pattern-stack_. The idea is that we will specialize the
//! leftmost pattern, which amounts to popping the constructor and pushing its fields, which feels
//! like a stack. We note a pattern-stack simply with `[p_1 ... p_n]`.
//! Here's a sequence of specializations of a list of pattern-stacks, to illustrate what's
//! happening:
//! ```
//! [Enum::Variant1(_)]
//! [Enum::Variant2(None, 0)]
//! [Enum::Variant2(Some(_), 0)]
//! //==>> specialize with `Variant2`
//! [None, 0]
//! [Some(_), 0]
//! //==>> specialize with `Some`
//! [_, 0]
//! //==>> specialize with `true` (say the type was `bool`)
//! [0]
//! //==>> specialize with `0`
//! []
//! ```
//!
//! The function `specialize(c, p)` takes a value constructor `c` and a pattern `p`, and returns 0
//! or more pattern-stacks. If `c` does not match the head constructor of `p`, it returns nothing;
//! otherwise if returns the fields of the constructor. This only returns more than one
//! pattern-stack if `p` has a pattern-only constructor.
//!
//! - Specializing for the wrong constructor returns nothing
//!
//!   `specialize(None, Some(p0)) := []`
//!
//! - Specializing for the correct constructor returns a single row with the fields
//!
//!   `specialize(Variant1, Variant1(p0, p1, p2)) := [[p0, p1, p2]]`
//!
//!   `specialize(Foo{..}, Foo { bar: p0, baz: p1 }) := [[p0, p1]]`
//!
//! - For or-patterns, we specialize each branch and concatenate the results
//!
//!   `specialize(c, p0 | p1) := specialize(c, p0) ++ specialize(c, p1)`
//!
//! - We treat the other pattern constructors as if they were a large or-pattern of all the
//!   possibilities:
//!
//!   `specialize(c, _) := specialize(c, Variant1(_) | Variant2(_, _) | ...)`
//!
//!   `specialize(c, 1..=100) := specialize(c, 1 | ... | 100)`
//!
//!   `specialize(c, [p0, .., p1]) := specialize(c, [p0, p1] | [p0, _, p1] | [p0, _, _, p1] | ...)`
//!
//! - If `c` is a pattern-only constructor, `specialize` is defined on a case-by-case basis. See
//!   the discussion about constructor splitting in [`super::deconstruct_pat`].
//!
//!
//! We then extend this function to work with pattern-stacks as input, by acting on the first
//! column and keeping the other columns untouched.
//!
//! Specialization for the whole matrix is done in [`Matrix::specialize_constructor`]. Note that
//! or-patterns in the first column are expanded before being stored in the matrix. Specialization
//! for a single patstack is done from a combination of [`Constructor::is_covered_by`] and
//! [`PatStack::pop_head_constructor`]. The internals of how it's done mostly live in the
//! [`Fields`] struct.
//!
//!
//! # Computing usefulness
//!
//! We now have all we need to compute usefulness. The inputs to usefulness are a list of
//! pattern-stacks `p_1 ... p_n` (one per row), and a new pattern_stack `q`. The paper and this
//! file calls the list of patstacks a _matrix_. They must all have the same number of columns and
//! the patterns in a given column must all have the same type. `usefulness` returns a (possibly
//! empty) list of witnesses of usefulness. These witnesses will also be pattern-stacks.
//!
//! - base case: `n_columns == 0`.
//!     Since a pattern-stack functions like a tuple of patterns, an empty one functions like the
//!     unit type. Thus `q` is useful iff there are no rows above it, i.e. if `n == 0`.
//!
//! - inductive case: `n_columns > 0`.
//!     We need a way to list the constructors we want to try. We will be more clever in the next
//!     section but for now assume we list all value constructors for the type of the first column.
//!
//!     - for each such ctor `c`:
//!
//!         - for each `q'` returned by `specialize(c, q)`:
//!
//!             - we compute `usefulness(specialize(c, p_1) ... specialize(c, p_n), q')`
//!
//!         - for each witness found, we revert specialization by pushing the constructor `c` on top.
//!
//!     - We return the concatenation of all the witnesses found, if any.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```
//! [Some(true)] // p_1
//! [None] // p_2
//! [Some(_)] // q
//! //==>> try `None`: `specialize(None, q)` returns nothing
//! //==>> try `Some`: `specialize(Some, q)` returns a single row
//! [true] // p_1'
//! [_] // q'
//! //==>> try `true`: `specialize(true, q')` returns a single row
//! [] // p_1''
//! [] // q''
//! //==>> base case; `n != 0` so `q''` is not useful.
//! //==>> go back up a step
//! [true] // p_1'
//! [_] // q'
//! //==>> try `false`: `specialize(false, q')` returns a single row
//! [] // q''
//! //==>> base case; `n == 0` so `q''` is useful. We return the single witness `[]`
//! witnesses:
//! []
//! //==>> undo the specialization with `false`
//! witnesses:
//! [false]
//! //==>> undo the specialization with `Some`
//! witnesses:
//! [Some(false)]
//! //==>> we have tried all the constructors. The output is the single witness `[Some(false)]`.
//! ```
//!
//! This computation is done in [`is_useful`]. In practice we don't care about the list of
//! witnesses when computing reachability; we only need to know whether any exist. We do keep the
//! witnesses when computing exhaustiveness to report them to the user.
//!
//!
//! # Making usefulness tractable: constructor splitting
//!
//! We're missing one last detail: which constructors do we list? Naively listing all value
//! constructors cannot work for types like `u64` or `&str`, so we need to be more clever. The
//! first obvious insight is that we only want to list constructors that are covered by the head
//! constructor of `q`. If it's a value constructor, we only try that one. If it's a pattern-only
//! constructor, we use the final clever idea for this algorithm: _constructor splitting_, where we
//! group together constructors that behave the same.
//!
//! The details are not necessary to understand this file, so we explain them in
//! [`super::deconstruct_pat`]. Splitting is done by the [`Constructor::split`] function.
