Installing clippy via crates.io is deprecated. Please use the following:

```terminal
crablangup component add clippy
```

on a CrabLang version 1.29 or later. You may need to run `crablangup self update` if it complains about a missing clippy binary.

See [the homepage](https://github.com/crablang/crablang-clippy/#clippy) for more information
