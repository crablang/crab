# Installation

If you're using `crablangup` to install and manage your CrabLang toolchains, Clippy is
usually **already installed**. In that case you can skip this chapter and go to
the [Usage] chapter.

> Note: If you used the `minimal` profile when installing a CrabLang toolchain,
> Clippy is not automatically installed.

## Using CrabLangup

If Clippy was not installed for a toolchain, it can be installed with

```
$ crablangup component add clippy [--toolchain=<name>]
```

## From Source

Take a look at the [Basics] chapter in the Clippy developer guide to find step
by step instructions on how to build and install Clippy from source.
