## NAME

cargo-package --- Assemble the local package into a distributable tarball

## SYNOPSIS

`cargo package` [_options_]

## DESCRIPTION

This command will create a distributable, compressed `.crate` file with the
source code of the package in the current directory. The resulting file will
be stored in the `target/package` directory. This performs the following
steps:

1. Load and check the current workspace, performing some basic checks.
    - Path dependencies are not allowed unless they have a version key. Cargo
      will ignore the path key for dependencies in published packages.
      `dev-dependencies` do not have this restriction.
2. Create the compressed `.crate` file.
    - The original `Cargo.toml` file is rewritten and normalized.
    - `[patch]`, `[replace]`, and `[workspace]` sections are removed from the
      manifest.
    - `Cargo.lock` is automatically included if the package contains an
      executable binary or example target. {{man "cargo-install" 1}} will use the
      packaged lock file if the `--locked` flag is used.
    - A `.cargo_vcs_info.json` file is included that contains information
      about the current VCS checkout hash if available (not included with
      `--allow-dirty`).
3. Extract the `.crate` file and build it to verify it can build.
    - This will rebuild your package from scratch to ensure that it can be
      built from a pristine state. The `--no-verify` flag can be used to skip
      this step.
4. Check that build scripts did not modify any source files.

The list of files included can be controlled with the `include` and `exclude`
fields in the manifest.

See [the reference](../reference/publishing.html) for more details about
packaging and publishing.

### .cargo_vcs_info.json format

Will generate a `.cargo_vcs_info.json` in the following format

```javascript
{
 "git": {
   "sha1": "aac20b6e7e543e6dd4118b246c77225e3a3a1302"
 },
 "path_in_vcs": ""
}
```

`path_in_vcs` will be set to a repo-relative path for packages
in subdirectories of the version control repository.
