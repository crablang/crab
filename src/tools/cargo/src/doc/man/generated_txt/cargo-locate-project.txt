CARGO-LOCATE-PROJECT(1)

NAME
       cargo-locate-project — Print a JSON representation of a Cargo.toml
       file’s location

SYNOPSIS
       cargo locate-project [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will print a JSON object to stdout with the full path to
       the manifest. The manifest is found by searching upward for a file named
       Cargo.toml starting from the current working directory.

       If the project happens to be a part of a workspace, the manifest of the
       project, rather than the workspace root, is output. This can be
       overridden by the --workspace flag. The root workspace is found by
       traversing further upward or by using the field package.workspace after
       locating the manifest of a workspace member.

OPTIONS
       --workspace
           Locate the Cargo.toml at the root of the workspace, as opposed to
           the current workspace member.

   Display Options
       --message-format fmt
           The representation in which to print the project location. Valid
           values:

           o  json (default): JSON object with the path under the key
              “root”.

           o  plain: Just the path.

       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Display the path to the manifest based on the current directory:

              cargo locate-project
