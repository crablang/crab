//! A `Source` for registry-based packages.
//!
//! # What's a Registry?
//!
//! [Registries] are central locations where packages can be uploaded to,
//! discovered, and searched for. The purpose of a registry is to have a
//! location that serves as permanent storage for versions of a crate over time.
//!
//! Compared to git sources (see [`GitSource`]), a registry provides many
//! packages as well as many versions simultaneously. Git sources can also
//! have commits deleted through rebasings where registries cannot have their
//! versions deleted.
//!
//! In Cargo, [`RegistryData`] is an abstraction over each kind of actual
//! registry, and [`RegistrySource`] connects those implementations to
//! [`Source`] trait. Two prominent features these abstractions provide are
//!
//! * A way to query the metadata of a package from a registry. The metadata
//!   comes from the index.
//! * A way to download package contents (a.k.a source files) that are required
//!   when building the package itself.
//!
//! We'll cover each functionality later.
//!
//! [Registries]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html
//! [`GitSource`]: super::GitSource
//!
//! # Different Kinds of Registries
//!
//! Cargo provides multiple kinds of registries. Each of them serves the index
//! and package contents in a slightly different way. Namely,
//!
//! * [`LocalRegistry`] --- Serves the index and package contents entirely on
//!   a local filesystem.
//! * [`RemoteRegistry`] --- Serves the index ahead of time from a Git
//!   repository, and package contents are downloaded as needed.
//! * [`HttpRegistry`] --- Serves both the index and package contents on demand
//!   over a HTTP-based registry API. This is the default starting from 1.70.0.
//!
//! Each registry has its own [`RegistryData`] implementation, and can be
//! created from either [`RegistrySource::local`] or [`RegistrySource::remote`].
//!
//! [`LocalRegistry`]: local::LocalRegistry
//! [`RemoteRegistry`]: remote::RemoteRegistry
//! [`HttpRegistry`]: http_remote::HttpRegistry
//!
//! # The Index of a Registry
//!
//! One of the major difficulties with a registry is that hosting so many
//! packages may quickly run into performance problems when dealing with
//! dependency graphs. It's infeasible for cargo to download the entire contents
//! of the registry just to resolve one package's dependencies, for example. As
//! a result, cargo needs some efficient method of querying what packages are
//! available on a registry, what versions are available, and what the
//! dependencies for each version is.
//!
//! To solve the problem, a registry must provide an index of package metadata.
//! The index of a registry is essentially an easily query-able version of the
//! registry's database for a list of versions of a package as well as a list
//! of dependencies for each version. The exact format of the index is
//! described later.
//!
//! See the [`index`] module for topics about the management, parsing, caching,
//! and versioning for the on-disk index.
//!
//! ## The Format of The Index
//!
//! The index is a store for the list of versions for all packages known, so its
//! format on disk is optimized slightly to ensure that `ls registry` doesn't
//! produce a list of all packages ever known. The index also wants to ensure
//! that there's not a million files which may actually end up hitting
//! filesystem limits at some point. To this end, a few decisions were made
//! about the format of the registry:
//!
//! 1. Each crate will have one file corresponding to it. Each version for a
//!    crate will just be a line in this file (see [`IndexPackage`] for its
//!    representation).
//! 2. There will be two tiers of directories for crate names, under which
//!    crates corresponding to those tiers will be located.
//!    (See [`cargo_util::registry::make_dep_path`] for the implementation of
//!    this layout hierarchy.)
//!
//! As an example, this is an example hierarchy of an index:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! .
//! ├── 3
//! │   └── u
//! │       └── url
//! ├── bz
//! │   └── ip
//! │       └── bzip2
//! ├── config.json
//! ├── en
//! │   └── co
//! │       └── encoding
//! └── li
//!     ├── bg
//!     │   └── libgit2
//!     └── nk
//!         └── link-config
//! ```
//!
//! The root of the index contains a `config.json` file with a few entries
//! corresponding to the registry (see [`RegistryConfig`] below).
//!
//! Otherwise, there are three numbered directories (1, 2, 3) for crates with
//! names 1, 2, and 3 characters in length. The 1/2 directories simply have the
//! crate files underneath them, while the 3 directory is sharded by the first
//! letter of the crate name.
//!
//! Otherwise the top-level directory contains many two-letter directory names,
//! each of which has many sub-folders with two letters. At the end of all these
//! are the actual crate files themselves.
//!
//! The purpose of this layout is to hopefully cut down on `ls` sizes as well as
//! efficient lookup based on the crate name itself.
//!
//! See [The Cargo Book: Registry Index][registry-index] for the public
//! interface on the index format.
//!
//! [registry-index]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registry-index.html
//!
//! ## The Index Files
//!
//! Each file in the index is the history of one crate over time. Each line in
//! the file corresponds to one version of a crate, stored in JSON format (see
//! the [`IndexPackage`] structure).
//!
//! As new versions are published, new lines are appended to this file. **The
//! only modifications to this file that should happen over time are yanks of a
//! particular version.**
//!
//! # Downloading Packages
//!
//! The purpose of the index was to provide an efficient method to resolve the
//! dependency graph for a package. After resolution has been performed, we need
//! to download the contents of packages so we can read the full manifest and
//! build the source code.
//!
//! To accomplish this, [`RegistryData::download`] will "make" an HTTP request
//! per-package requested to download tarballs into a local cache. These
//! tarballs will then be unpacked into a destination folder.
//!
//! Note that because versions uploaded to the registry are frozen forever that
//! the HTTP download and unpacking can all be skipped if the version has
//! already been downloaded and unpacked. This caching allows us to only
//! download a package when absolutely necessary.
//!
//! # Filesystem Hierarchy
//!
//! Overall, the `$HOME/.cargo` looks like this when talking about the registry
//! (remote registries, specifically):
//!
//! ```notrust
//! # A folder under which all registry metadata is hosted (similar to
//! # $HOME/.cargo/git)
//! $HOME/.cargo/registry/
//!
//!     # For each registry that cargo knows about (keyed by hostname + hash)
//!     # there is a folder which is the checked out version of the index for
//!     # the registry in this location. Note that this is done so cargo can
//!     # support multiple registries simultaneously
//!     index/
//!         registry1-<hash>/
//!         registry2-<hash>/
//!         ...
//!
//!     # This folder is a cache for all downloaded tarballs (`.crate` file)
//!     # from a registry. Once downloaded and verified, a tarball never changes.
//!     cache/
//!         registry1-<hash>/<pkg>-<version>.crate
//!         ...
//!
//!     # Location in which all tarballs are unpacked. Each tarball is known to
//!     # be frozen after downloading, so transitively this folder is also
//!     # frozen once its unpacked (it's never unpacked again)
//!     # CAVEAT: They are not read-only. See rust-lang/cargo#9455.
//!     src/
//!         registry1-<hash>/<pkg>-<version>/...
//!         ...
//! ```
