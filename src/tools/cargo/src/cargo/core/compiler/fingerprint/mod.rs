//! Tracks changes to determine if something needs to be recompiled.
//!
//! This module implements change-tracking so that Cargo can know whether or
//! not something needs to be recompiled. A Cargo [`Unit`] can be either "dirty"
//! (needs to be recompiled) or "fresh" (it does not need to be recompiled).
//!
//! ## Mechanisms affecting freshness
//!
//! There are several mechanisms that influence a Unit's freshness:
//!
//! - The [`Fingerprint`] is a hash, saved to the filesystem in the
//!   `.fingerprint` directory, that tracks information about the Unit. If the
//!   fingerprint is missing (such as the first time the unit is being
//!   compiled), then the unit is dirty. If any of the fingerprint fields
//!   change (like the name of the source file), then the Unit is considered
//!   dirty.
//!
//!   The `Fingerprint` also tracks the fingerprints of all its dependencies,
//!   so a change in a dependency will propagate the "dirty" status up.
//!
//! - Filesystem mtime tracking is also used to check if a unit is dirty.
//!   See the section below on "Mtime comparison" for more details. There
//!   are essentially two parts to mtime tracking:
//!
//!   1. The mtime of a Unit's output files is compared to the mtime of all
//!      its dependencies' output file mtimes (see
//!      [`check_filesystem`]). If any output is missing, or is
//!      older than a dependency's output, then the unit is dirty.
//!   2. The mtime of a Unit's source files is compared to the mtime of its
//!      dep-info file in the fingerprint directory (see [`find_stale_file`]).
//!      The dep-info file is used as an anchor to know when the last build of
//!      the unit was done. See the "dep-info files" section below for more
//!      details. If any input files are missing, or are newer than the
//!      dep-info, then the unit is dirty.
//!
//! Note: Fingerprinting is not a perfect solution. Filesystem mtime tracking
//! is notoriously imprecise and problematic. Only a small part of the
//! environment is captured. This is a balance of performance, simplicity, and
//! completeness. Sandboxing, hashing file contents, tracking every file
//! access, environment variable, and network operation would ensure more
//! reliable and reproducible builds at the cost of being complex, slow, and
//! platform-dependent.
//!
//! ## Fingerprints and Metadata
//!
//! The [`Metadata`] hash is a hash added to the output filenames to isolate
//! each unit. See its documentationfor more details.
//! NOTE: Not all output files are isolated via filename hashes (like dylibs).
//! The fingerprint directory uses a hash, but sometimes units share the same
//! fingerprint directory (when they don't have Metadata) so care should be
//! taken to handle this!
//!
//! Fingerprints and Metadata are similar, and track some of the same things.
//! The Metadata contains information that is required to keep Units separate.
//! The Fingerprint includes additional information that should cause a
//! recompile, but it is desired to reuse the same filenames. A comparison
//! of what is tracked:
//!
//! Value                                      | Fingerprint | Metadata

//!
//! When deciding what should go in the Metadata vs the Fingerprint, consider
//! that some files (like dylibs) do not have a hash in their filename. Thus,
//! if a value changes, only the fingerprint will detect the change (consider,
//! for example, swapping between different features). Fields that are only in
//! Metadata generally aren't relevant to the fingerprint because they
//! fundamentally change the output (like target vs host changes the directory
//! where it is emitted).
//!
//! ## Fingerprint files
//!
//! Fingerprint information is stored in the
//! `target/{debug,release}/.fingerprint/` directory. Each Unit is stored in a
//! separate directory. Each Unit directory contains:
//!
//! - A file with a 16 hex-digit hash. This is the Fingerprint hash, used for
//!   quick loading and comparison.
//! - A `.json` file that contains details about the Fingerprint. This is only
//!   used to log details about *why* a fingerprint is considered dirty.
//!   `CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=trace cargo build` can be
//!   used to display this log information.
//! - A "dep-info" file which is a translation of rustc's `*.d` dep-info files
//!   to a Cargo-specific format that tweaks file names and is optimized for
//!   reading quickly.
//! - An `invoked.timestamp` file whose filesystem mtime is updated every time
//!   the Unit is built. This is used for capturing the time when the build
//!   starts, to detect if files are changed in the middle of the build. See
//!   below for more details.
//!
//! Note that some units are a little different. A Unit for *running* a build
//! script or for `rustdoc` does not have a dep-info file (it's not
//! applicable). Build script `invoked.timestamp` files are in the build
//! output directory.
//!
//! ## Fingerprint calculation
//!
//! After the list of Units has been calculated, the Units are added to the
//! [`JobQueue`]. As each one is added, the fingerprint is calculated, and the
//! dirty/fresh status is recorded. A closure is used to update the fingerprint
//! on-disk when the Unit successfully finishes. The closure will recompute the
//! Fingerprint based on the updated information. If the Unit fails to compile,
//! the fingerprint is not updated.
//!
//! Fingerprints are cached in the [`Context`]. This makes computing
//! Fingerprints faster, but also is necessary for properly updating
//! dependency information. Since a Fingerprint includes the Fingerprints of
//! all dependencies, when it is updated, by using `Arc` clones, it
//! automatically picks up the updates to its dependencies.
//!
//! ### dep-info files
//!
//! Cargo has several kinds of "dep info" files:
//!
//! * dep-info files generated by `rustc`.
//! * Fingerprint dep-info files translated from the first one.
//! * dep-info for external build system integration.
//! * Unstable `-Zbinary-dep-depinfo`.
//!
//! #### `rustc` dep-info files
//!
//! Cargo passes the `--emit=dep-info` flag to `rustc` so that `rustc` will
//! generate a "dep info" file (with the `.d` extension). This is a
//! Makefile-like syntax that includes all of the source files used to build
//! the crate. This file is used by Cargo to know which files to check to see
//! if the crate will need to be rebuilt. Example:
//!
//! ```makefile
//! /path/to/target/debug/deps/cargo-b6219d178925203d: src/bin/main.rs src/bin/cargo/cli.rs # … etc.
//! ```
//!
//! #### Fingerprint dep-info files
//!
//! After `rustc` exits successfully, Cargo will read the first kind of dep
//! info file and translate it into a binary format that is stored in the
//! fingerprint directory ([`translate_dep_info`]).
//!
//! These are used to quickly scan for any changed files. The mtime of the
//! fingerprint dep-info file itself is used as the reference for comparing the
//! source files to determine if any of the source files have been modified
//! (see [below](#mtime-comparison) for more detail).
//!
//! Note that Cargo parses the special `# env-var:...` comments in dep-info
//! files to learn about environment variables that the rustc compile depends on.
//! Cargo then later uses this to trigger a recompile if a referenced env var
//! changes (even if the source didn't change).
//!
//! #### dep-info files for build system integration.
//!
//! There is also a third dep-info file. Cargo will extend the file created by
//! rustc with some additional information and saves this into the output
//! directory. This is intended for build system integration. See the
//! [`output_depinfo`] function for more detail.
//!
//! #### -Zbinary-dep-depinfo
//!
//! `rustc` has an experimental flag `-Zbinary-dep-depinfo`. This causes
//! `rustc` to include binary files (like rlibs) in the dep-info file. This is
//! primarily to support rustc development, so that Cargo can check the
//! implicit dependency to the standard library (which lives in the sysroot).
//! We want Cargo to recompile whenever the standard library rlib/dylibs
//! change, and this is a generic mechanism to make that work.
//!
//! ### Mtime comparison
//!
//! The use of modification timestamps is the most common way a unit will be
//! determined to be dirty or fresh between builds. There are many subtle
//! issues and edge cases with mtime comparisons. This gives a high-level
//! overview, but you'll need to read the code for the gritty details. Mtime
//! handling is different for different unit kinds. The different styles are
//! driven by the [`Fingerprint::local`] field, which is set based on the unit
//! kind.
//!
//! The status of whether or not the mtime is "stale" or "up-to-date" is
//! stored in [`Fingerprint::fs_status`].
//!
//! All units will compare the mtime of its newest output file with the mtimes
//! of the outputs of all its dependencies. If any output file is missing,
//! then the unit is stale. If any dependency is newer, the unit is stale.
//!
//! #### Normal package mtime handling
//!
//! [`LocalFingerprint::CheckDepInfo`] is used for checking the mtime of
//! packages. It compares the mtime of the input files (the source files) to
//! the mtime of the dep-info file (which is written last after a build is
//! finished). If the dep-info is missing, the unit is stale (it has never
//! been built). The list of input files comes from the dep-info file. See the
//! section above for details on dep-info files.
//!
//! Also note that although registry and git packages use [`CheckDepInfo`], none
//! of their source files are included in the dep-info (see
//! [`translate_dep_info`]), so for those kinds no mtime checking is done
//! (unless `-Zbinary-dep-depinfo` is used). Repository and git packages are
//! static, so there is no need to check anything.
//!
//! When a build is complete, the mtime of the dep-info file in the
//! fingerprint directory is modified to rewind it to the time when the build
//! started. This is done by creating an `invoked.timestamp` file when the
//! build starts to capture the start time. The mtime is rewound to the start
//! to handle the case where the user modifies a source file while a build is
//! running. Cargo can't know whether or not the file was included in the
//! build, so it takes a conservative approach of assuming the file was *not*
//! included, and it should be rebuilt during the next build.
//!
//! #### Rustdoc mtime handling
//!
//! Rustdoc does not emit a dep-info file, so Cargo currently has a relatively
//! simple system for detecting rebuilds. [`LocalFingerprint::Precalculated`] is
//! used for rustdoc units. For registry packages, this is the package
//! version. For git packages, it is the git hash. For path packages, it is
//! the a string of the mtime of the newest file in the package.
//!
//! There are some known bugs with how this works, so it should be improved at
//! some point.
//!
//! #### Build script mtime handling
//!
//! Build script mtime handling runs in different modes. There is the "old
//! style" where the build script does not emit any `rerun-if` directives. In
//! this mode, Cargo will use [`LocalFingerprint::Precalculated`]. See the
//! "rustdoc" section above how it works.
//!
//! In the new-style, each `rerun-if` directive is translated to the
//! corresponding [`LocalFingerprint`] variant. The [`RerunIfChanged`] variant
//! compares the mtime of the given filenames against the mtime of the
//! "output" file.
//!
//! Similar to normal units, the build script "output" file mtime is rewound
//! to the time just before the build script is executed to handle mid-build
//! modifications.
//!
//! ## Considerations for inclusion in a fingerprint
//!
//! Over time we've realized a few items which historically were included in
//! fingerprint hashings should not actually be included. Examples are:
//!
//! * Modification time values. We strive to never include a modification time
//!   inside a `Fingerprint` to get hashed into an actual value. While
//!   theoretically fine to do, in practice this causes issues with common
//!   applications like Docker. Docker, after a layer is built, will zero out
//!   the nanosecond part of all filesystem modification times. This means that
//!   the actual modification time is different for all build artifacts, which
//!   if we tracked the actual values of modification times would cause
//!   unnecessary recompiles. To fix this we instead only track paths which are
//!   relevant. These paths are checked dynamically to see if they're up to
//!   date, and the modification time doesn't make its way into the fingerprint
//!   hash.
//!
//! * Absolute path names. We strive to maintain a property where if you rename
//!   a project directory Cargo will continue to preserve all build artifacts
//!   and reuse the cache. This means that we can't ever hash an absolute path
//!   name. Instead we always hash relative path names and the "root" is passed
//!   in at runtime dynamically. Some of this is best effort, but the general
//!   idea is that we assume all accesses within a crate stay within that
//!   crate.
//!
//! These are pretty tricky to test for unfortunately, but we should have a good
//! test suite nowadays and lord knows Cargo gets enough testing in the wild!
//!
//! ## Build scripts
//!
//! The *running* of a build script ([`CompileMode::RunCustomBuild`]) is treated
//! significantly different than all other Unit kinds. It has its own function
//! for calculating the Fingerprint ([`calculate_run_custom_build`]) and has some
//! unique considerations. It does not track the same information as a normal
//! Unit. The information tracked depends on the `rerun-if-changed` and
//! `rerun-if-env-changed` statements produced by the build script. If the
//! script does not emit either of these statements, the Fingerprint runs in
//! "old style" mode where an mtime change of *any* file in the package will
//! cause the build script to be re-run. Otherwise, the fingerprint *only*
//! tracks the individual "rerun-if" items listed by the build script.
//!
//! The "rerun-if" statements from a *previous* build are stored in the build
//! output directory in a file called `output`. Cargo parses this file when
//! the Unit for that build script is prepared for the [`JobQueue`]. The
//! Fingerprint code can then use that information to compute the Fingerprint
//! and compare against the old fingerprint hash.
//!
//! Care must be taken with build script Fingerprints because the
//! [`Fingerprint::local`] value may be changed after the build script runs
//! (such as if the build script adds or removes "rerun-if" items).
//!
//! Another complication is if a build script is overridden. In that case, the
//! fingerprint is the hash of the output of the override.
//!
//! ## Special considerations
//!
//! Registry dependencies do not track the mtime of files. This is because
//! registry dependencies are not expected to change (if a new version is
//! used, the Package ID will change, causing a rebuild). Cargo currently
//! partially works with Docker caching. When a Docker image is built, it has
//! normal mtime information. However, when a step is cached, the nanosecond
//! portions of all files is zeroed out. Currently this works, but care must
//! be taken for situations like these.
//!
//! HFS on macOS only supports 1 second timestamps. This causes a significant
//! number of problems, particularly with Cargo's testsuite which does rapid
//! builds in succession. Other filesystems have various degrees of
//! resolution.
//!
//! Various weird filesystems (such as network filesystems) also can cause
//! complications. Network filesystems may track the time on the server
//! (except when the time is set manually such as with
//! `filetime::set_file_times`). Not all filesystems support modifying the
//! mtime.

/// `&BuildDeps`. This is the parsed version of a build script, and when Cargo
/// starts up this is cached from previous runs of a build script.  After a
/// build script executes the output file is reparsed and passed in here.
///
/// The second argument is the weirdest, it's *optionally* a closure to
/// call [`pkg_fingerprint`]. The `pkg_fingerprint` requires access to
/// "source map" located in `Context`. That's very non-`'static` and
/// non-`Send`, so it can't be used on other threads, such as when we invoke
/// this after a build script has finished. The `Option` allows us to for sure
/// calculate it on the main thread at the beginning, and then swallow the bug
/// for now where a worker thread after a build script has finished doesn't
/// have access. Ideally there would be no second argument or it would be more
/// "first class" and not an `Option` but something that can be sent between
/// threads. In any case, it's a bug for now.
