.SH "NAME"
cargo\-vendor \[em] Vendor all dependencies locally
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo vendor\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIpath\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This cargo subcommand will vendor all crates.io and git dependencies for a
project into the specified directory at \fB<path>\fR\&. After this command completes
the vendor directory specified by \fB<path>\fR will contain all remote sources from
dependencies specified. Additional manifests beyond the default one can be
specified with the \fB\-s\fR option.
.sp
The \fBcargo vendor\fR command will also print out the configuration necessary
to use the vendored sources, which you will need to add to \fB\&.cargo/config.toml\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Vendor Options"
.sp
\fB\-s\fR \fImanifest\fR, 
\fB\-\-sync\fR \fImanifest\fR
.RS 4
Specify an extra \fBCargo.toml\fR manifest to workspaces which should also be
vendored and synced to the output. May be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-delete\fR
.RS 4
Don\[cq]t delete the \[lq]vendor\[rq] directory when vendoring, but rather keep all
existing contents of the vendor directory
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-respect\-source\-config\fR
.RS 4
Instead of ignoring \fB[source]\fR configuration by default in \fB\&.cargo/config.toml\fR
read it and use it when downloading crates from crates.io, for example
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-versioned\-dirs\fR
.RS 4
Normally versions are only added to disambiguate multiple versions of the
same package. This option causes all directories in the \[lq]vendor\[rq] directory
to be versioned, which makes it easier to track the history of vendored
packages over time, and can help with the performance of re\-vendoring when
only a subset of the packages have changed.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fR file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fR file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fR, 
\fB\-\-locked\fR
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fR file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fR flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fR file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fR
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fR(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fR, 
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for \[lq]very verbose\[rq] output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fR, 
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Do not print cargo log messages.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.quiet\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-color\fR \fIwhen\fR

terminal.

.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB+\fR\fItoolchain\fR
.RS 4
If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to \fBcargo\fR
begins with \fB+\fR, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such
as \fB+stable\fR or \fB+nightly\fR).
See the \fIrustup documentation\fR <https://rust\-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html>
for more information about how toolchain overrides work.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-config\fR \fIKEY=VALUE\fR or \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of \fBKEY=VALUE\fR,
or provided as a path to an extra configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times.
See the \fIcommand\-line overrides section\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command\-line\-overrides> for more information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Changes the current working directory before executing any specified operations. This affects
things like where cargo looks by default for the project manifest (\fBCargo.toml\fR), as well as
the directories searched for discovering \fB\&.cargo/config.toml\fR, for example. This option must
appear before the command name, for example \fBcargo \-C path/to/my\-project build\fR\&.
.sp
This option is only available on the \fInightly
channel\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/book/appendix\-07\-nightly\-rust.html> and
requires the \fB\-Z unstable\-options\fR flag to enable (see
\fI#10098\fR <https://github.com/rust\-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).
