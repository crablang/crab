warning: compiling this new package may not work due to invalid workspace configuration

current package believes it's in a workspace when it's not:
current:   [ROOT]/case/foo/Cargo.toml
workspace: [ROOT]/case/Cargo.toml

this may be fixable by adding `foo` to the `workspace.members` array of the manifest located at: [ROOT]/case/Cargo.toml
Alternatively, to keep it out of the workspace, add the package to the `workspace.exclude` array, or add an empty `[workspace]` table to the package's manifest.
     Created binary (application) `foo` package
