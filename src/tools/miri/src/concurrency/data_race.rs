//! Implementation of a data-race detector using Lamport Timestamps / Vector-clocks
//! based on the Dynamic Race Detection for C++:
//! <https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/homepages/papers/pdfs/2017/POPL.pdf>
//! which does not report false-positives when fences are used, and gives better
//! accuracy in presence of read-modify-write operations.
//!
//! The implementation contains modifications to correctly model the changes to the memory model in C++20
//! regarding the weakening of release sequences: <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0982r1.html>.
//! Relaxed stores now unconditionally block all currently active release sequences and so per-thread tracking of release
//! sequences is not needed.
//!
//! The implementation also models races with memory allocation and deallocation via treating allocation and
//! deallocation as a type of write internally for detecting data-races.
//!
//! Weak memory orders are explored but not all weak behaviours are exhibited, so it can still miss data-races
//! but should not report false-positives
//!
//! Data-race definition from(<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/memory_model#Threads_and_data_races>):
//! a data race occurs between two memory accesses if they are on different threads, at least one operation
//! is non-atomic, at least one operation is a write and neither access happens-before the other. Read the link
//! for full definition.
//!
//! This re-uses vector indexes for threads that are known to be unable to report data-races, this is valid
//! because it only re-uses vector indexes once all currently-active (not-terminated) threads have an internal
//! vector clock that happens-after the join operation of the candidate thread. Threads that have not been joined
//! on are not considered. Since the thread's vector clock will only increase and a data-race implies that
//! there is some index x where `clock[x] > thread_clock`, when this is true `clock[candidate-idx] > thread_clock`
//! can never hold and hence a data-race can never be reported in that vector index again.
//! This means that the thread-index can be safely re-used, starting on the next timestamp for the newly created
//! thread.
//!
//! The timestamps used in the data-race detector assign each sequence of non-atomic operations
//! followed by a single atomic or concurrent operation a single timestamp.
//! Write, Read, Write, ThreadJoin will be represented by a single timestamp value on a thread.
//! This is because extra increment operations between the operations in the sequence are not
//! required for accurate reporting of data-race values.
//!
//! As per the paper a threads timestamp is only incremented after a release operation is performed
//! so some atomic operations that only perform acquires do not increment the timestamp. Due to shared
//! code some atomic operations may increment the timestamp when not necessary but this has no effect
//! on the data-race detection code.
