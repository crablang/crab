error: Undefined Behavior: atomic operations cannot be performed on read-only memory
       many platforms require atomic read-modify-write instructions to be performed on writeable memory, even if the operation fails (and is hence nominally read-only)
       some platforms implement (some) atomic loads via compare-exchange, which means they do not work on read-only memory; it is possible that we could have an exception permitting this for specific kinds of loads
       please report an issue at <https://github.com/crablang/miri/issues> if this is a problem for you
