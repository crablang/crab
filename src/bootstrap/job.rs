//! Job management on Windows for bootstrapping
//!
//! Most of the time when you're running a build system (e.g., make) you expect
//! Ctrl-C or abnormal termination to actually terminate the entire tree of
//! process in play, not just the one at the top. This currently works "by
//! default" on Unix platforms because Ctrl-C actually sends a signal to the
//! *process group* rather than the parent process, so everything will get torn
//! down. On Windows, however, this does not happen and Ctrl-C just kills the
//! parent process.
//!
//! To achieve the same semantics on Windows we use Job Objects to ensure that
//! all processes die at the same time. Job objects have a mode of operation
//! where when all handles to the object are closed it causes all child
//! processes associated with the object to be terminated immediately.
//! Conveniently whenever a process in the job object spawns a new process the
//! child will be associated with the job object as well. This means if we add
//! ourselves to the job object we create then everything will get torn down!
//!
//! Unfortunately most of the time the build system is actually called from a
//! python wrapper (which manages things like building the build system) so this
//! all doesn't quite cut it so far. To go the last mile we duplicate the job
//! object handle into our parent process (a python process probably) and then
//! close our own handle. This means that the only handle to the job object
//! resides in the parent python process, so when python dies the whole build
//! system dies (as one would probably expect!).
//!
//! Note that this module has a #[cfg(windows)] above it as none of this logic
//! is required on Unix.
