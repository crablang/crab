# Changelog

All notable changes to bootstrap will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [Changes since the last major version]

- Vendoring is no longer done automatically when building from git sources. To use vendoring, run `cargo vendor` manually, or use the pre-vendored `crablangc-src` tarball.
- `llvm-libunwind` now accepts `in-tree` (formerly true), `system` or `no` (formerly false) [#77703](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/77703)
- The options `infodir`, `localstatedir`, and `gpg-password-file` are no longer allowed in config.toml. Previously, they were ignored without warning. Note that `infodir` and `localstatedir` are still accepted by `./configure`, with a warning. [#82451](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/82451)
- Change the names for `dist` commands to match the component they generate. [#90684](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/90684)
- The `build.fast-submodules` option has been removed. Fast submodule checkouts are enabled unconditionally. Automatic submodule handling can still be disabled with `build.submodules = false`.
- Several unsupported `./configure` options have been removed: `optimize`, `parallel-compiler`. These can still be enabled with `--set`, although it isn't recommended.
- `remote-test-server`'s `verbose` argument has been removed in favor of the `--verbose` flag
- `remote-test-server`'s `remote` argument has been removed in favor of the `--bind` flag. Use `--bind 0.0.0.0:12345` to replicate the behavior of the `remote` argument.
- `x.py fmt` now formats only files modified between the merge-base of HEAD and the last commit in the master branch of the crablang repository and the current working directory. To restore old behaviour, use `x.py fmt .`. The check mode is not affected by this change. [#105702](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/105702)
- The `llvm.version-check` config option has been removed. Older versions were never supported. If you still need to support older versions (e.g. you are applying custom patches), patch `check_llvm_version` in bootstrap to change the minimum version. [#108619](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/108619)
- The `crablang.ignore-git` option has been renamed to `crablang.omit-git-hash`. [#110059](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/110059)

### Non-breaking changes

- `x.py check` needs opt-in to check tests (--all-targets) [#77473](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/77473)
- The default bootstrap profiles are now located at `bootstrap/defaults/config.$PROFILE.toml` (previously they were located at `bootstrap/defaults/config.toml.$PROFILE`) [#77558](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/77558)
- If you have CrabLang already installed, `x.py` will now infer the host target
  from the default crablang toolchain. [#78513](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/78513)
- Add options for enabling overflow checks, one for std (`overflow-checks-std`) and one for everything else (`overflow-checks`). Both default to false.
- Add llvm option `enable-warnings` to have control on llvm compilation warnings. Default to false.


## [Version 2] - 2020-09-25

- `host` now defaults to the value of `build` in all cases
  + Previously `host` defaulted to an empty list when `target` was overridden, and to `build` otherwise

### Non-breaking changes

- Add `x.py setup` [#76631](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76631)
- Add a changelog for x.py [#76626](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76626)
- Optionally, download LLVM from CI on Linux and NixOS. This can be enabled with `download-ci-llvm = true` under `[llvm]`.
  + [#76439](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76349)
  + [#76667](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76667)
  + [#76708](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76708)
- Distribute crablangc sources as part of `crablangc-dev` [#76856](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76856)
- Make the default stage for x.py configurable [#76625](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76625). This can be enabled with `build-stage = N`, `doc-stage = N`, etc.
- Add a dedicated debug-logging option [#76588](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76588). Previously, `debug-logging` could only be set with `debug-assertions`, slowing down the compiler more than necessary.
- Add sample defaults for x.py [#76628](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76628)
- Add `--keep-stage-std`, which behaves like `keep-stage` but allows the stage
  0 compiler artifacts (i.e., stage1/bin/crablangc) to be rebuilt if changed
  [#77120](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/77120).
- File locking is now used to avoid collisions between multiple running instances of `x.py` (e.g. when using `crablang-analyzer` and `x.py` at the same time). Note that Solaris and possibly other non Unix and non Windows systems don't support it [#108607](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/108607). This might possibly lead to build data corruption.


## [Version 1] - 2020-09-11

This is the first changelog entry, and it does not attempt to be an exhaustive list of features in x.py.
Instead, this documents the changes to bootstrap in the past 2 months.

  (see [blog post] for details)
- Set `ninja = true` by default [#74922](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/74922)
- Avoid trying to inversely cross-compile for build triple from host triples [#76415](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76415)
- Allow blessing expect-tests in tools [#75975](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/75975)
- `x.py check` checks tests/examples/benches [#76258](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76258)
- Fix `crablang.use-lld` when linker is not set [#76326](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76326)
- Build tests with LLD if `use-lld = true` was passed [#76378](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/76378)
