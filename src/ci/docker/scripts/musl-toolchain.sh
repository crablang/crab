# This script runs `musl-cross-make` to prepare C toolchain (Binutils, GCC, musl itself)
# and builds static libunwind that we distribute for static target.
#
# Versions of the toolchain components are configurable in `musl-cross-make/Makefile` and
# musl unlike GLIBC is forward compatible so upgrading it shouldn't break old distributions.
# Right now we have: Binutils 2.31.1, GCC 9.2.0, musl 1.1.24.

# Fix the cfi detection script in musl's configure so cfi is generated

# When we upgrade to a version that includes this commit, we can remove the patch.
