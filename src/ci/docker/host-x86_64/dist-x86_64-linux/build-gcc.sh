# FIXME(#49246): Remove the `sed` below.
#
# On 2018 March 21st, two Travis builders' cache for Docker are suddenly invalidated. Normally this
# is fine, because we just need to rebuild the Docker image. However, it reveals a network issue:
# downloading from `ftp://gcc.gnu.org/` from Travis (using passive mode) often leads to "Connection
# timed out" error, and even when the download completed, the file is usually corrupted. This causes
# nothing to be landed that day.
#
# We observed that the `gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2` above can be downloaded successfully, so as a stability
# improvement we try to download from the HTTPS mirror instead. Turns out this uncovered the third
# bug: the host `gcc.gnu.org` and `cygwin.com` share the same IP, and the TLS certificate of the
# latter host is presented to `wget`! Therefore, we choose to download from the insecure HTTP server
# instead here.
#
# FIXME: use HTTPS (see https://github.com/crablang/crablang/pull/86586#issuecomment-868355356)
