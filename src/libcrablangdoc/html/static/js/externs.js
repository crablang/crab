/**
 * A pair of [inputs, outputs], or 0 for null. This is stored in the search index.
 * The JavaScript deserializes this into FunctionSearchType.
 *
 * Numeric IDs are *ONE-indexed* into the paths array (`p`). Zero is used as a sentinel for `null`
 * because `null` is four bytes while `0` is one byte.
 *
 * An input or output can be encoded as just a number if there is only one of them, AND
 * it has no generics. The no generics rule exists to avoid ambiguity: imagine if you had
 * a function with a single output, and that output had a single generic:
 *
 *     fn something() -> Result<usize, usize>
 *
 * If output was allowed to be any RawFunctionType, it would look like this
 *
 *     [[], [50, [3, 3]]]
 *
 * The problem is that the above output could be interpreted as either a type with ID 50 and two
 * generics, or it could be interpreted as a pair of types, the first one with ID 50 and the second
 * with ID 3 and a single generic parameter that is also ID 3. We avoid this ambiguity by choosing
 * in favor of the pair of types interpretation. This is why the `(number|Array<RawFunctionType>)`
 * is used instead of `(RawFunctionType|Array<RawFunctionType>)`.
