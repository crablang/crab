[travis-repo]: https://travis-ci.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example

Learn Rust with examples (Live code editor included)

## Using

If you'd like to read Rust by Example, you can visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/>
to read it online.

If you'd like to read it locally, [install Rust], and then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
cd rust-by-example
cargo install mdbook
mdbook build
mdbook serve
```

[install Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

To be able to run the examples, you must be connected to the internet; you can
read all content offline, however!

The following warnings can be ignored safely.

```
[WARN] (mdbook::preprocess::cmd): The command wasn't found, is the "gettext" preprocessor installed?
[WARN] (mdbook::preprocess::cmd):   Command: mdbook-gettext
```

### Using translated version

If there is a translated resource in `po/` directory, it can be specified through `MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE` like below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
cd rust-by-example
cargo install mdbook
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=ja mdbook build
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=ja mdbook serve
```
