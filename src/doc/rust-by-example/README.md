Learn Rust with examples (Live code editor included)

## Using

If you'd like to read Rust by Example, you can visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/>
to read it online.

If you'd like to read it locally, [install Rust], and then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
cd rust-by-example
cargo install mdbook
mdbook build
mdbook serve
```

[install Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

To be able to run the examples, you must be connected to the internet; you can
read all content offline, however!
