# Cargo

`cargo` is the official Rust package management tool. It has lots of really
useful features to improve code quality and developer velocity! These include

- Dependency management and integration with [crates.io](https://crates.io) (the
  official Rust package registry)
- Awareness of unit tests
- Awareness of benchmarks

This chapter will go through some quick basics, but you can find the
comprehensive docs in [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
