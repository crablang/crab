# Attributes

An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item. This metadata
can be used to/for:

<!-- TODO: Link these to their respective examples -->

* [conditional compilation of code][cfg]
* [set crate name, version and type (binary or library)][crate]
* disable [lints][lint] (warnings)
* enable compiler features (macros, glob imports, etc.)
* link to a foreign library
* mark functions as unit tests
* mark functions that will be part of a benchmark
* [attribute like macros][macros]

Attributes look like `#[outer_attribute]` or `#![inner_attribute]`,
with the difference between them being where they apply.

- `#[outer_attribute]` applies to the [item][item] immediately
  following it. Some examples of items are: a function, a module
  declaration, a constant, a structure, an enum. Here is an example
  where attribute `#[derive(Debug)]` applies to the struct
  `Rectangle`:
  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  struct Rectangle {
      width: u32,
      height: u32,
  }
  ```

- `#![inner_attribute]` applies to the enclosing [item][item] (typically a
  module or a crate). In other words, this attribute is interpreted as
  applying to the entire scope in which it's place. Here is an example
  where `#![allow(unused_variables)]` applies to the whole crate (if
  placed in `main.rs`):
  ```rust
  #![allow(unused_variables)]

  fn main() {
      let x = 3; // This would normally warn about an unused variable.
  }
  ```

Attributes can take arguments with different syntaxes:

* `#[attribute = "value"]`
* `#[attribute(key = "value")]`
* `#[attribute(value)]`

Attributes can have multiple values and can be separated over multiple lines, too:

```rust,ignore
#[attribute(value, value2)]


#[attribute(value, value2, value3,
            value4, value5)]
```
