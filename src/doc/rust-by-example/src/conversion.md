# Conversion

Primitive types can be converted to each other through [casting].

Rust addresses conversion between custom types (i.e., `struct` and `enum`)
by the use of [traits]. The generic
conversions will use the [`From`] and [`Into`] traits. However there are more
specific ones for the more common cases, in particular when converting to and
from `String`s.
