# RAII

Variables in Rust do more than just hold data in the stack: they also *own*
resources, e.g. `Box<T>` owns memory in the heap. Rust enforces [RAII][raii]
(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), so whenever an object goes out of
scope, its destructor is called and its owned resources are freed.

This behavior shields against *resource leak* bugs, so you'll never have to
manually free memory or worry about memory leaks again! Here's a quick showcase:

```rust,editable
// raii.rs
fn create_box() {
    // Allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box1 = Box::new(3i32);

    // `_box1` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
}

fn main() {
    // Allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box2 = Box::new(5i32);

    // A nested scope:
    {
        // Allocate an integer on the heap
        let _box3 = Box::new(4i32);

        // `_box3` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
    }

    // Creating lots of boxes just for fun
    // There's no need to manually free memory!
    for _ in 0u32..1_000 {
        create_box();
    }

    // `_box2` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
}
```

Of course, we can double check for memory errors using [`valgrind`][valgrind]:

<!-- REUSE-IgnoreStart -->

No leaks here!

## Destructor

The notion of a destructor in Rust is provided through the [`Drop`] trait. The
destructor is called when the resource goes out of scope. This trait is not
required to be implemented for every type, only implement it for your type if
you require its own destructor logic.

Run the below example to see how the [`Drop`] trait works. When the variable in
the `main` function goes out of scope the custom destructor will be invoked.

```rust,editable
struct ToDrop;

impl Drop for ToDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("ToDrop is being dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = ToDrop;
    println!("Made a ToDrop!");
}
```
