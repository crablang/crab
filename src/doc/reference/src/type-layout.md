# Type Layout

The layout of a type is its size, alignment, and the relative offsets of its
fields. For enums, how the discriminant is laid out and interpreted is also part
of type layout.

Type layout can be changed with each compilation. Instead of trying to document
exactly what is done, we only document what is guaranteed today.

## Size and Alignment

All values have an alignment and size.

The *alignment* of a value specifies what addresses are valid to store the value
at. A value of alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a
multiple of n. For example, a value with an alignment of 2 must be stored at an
even address, while a value with an alignment of 1 can be stored at any address.
Alignment is measured in bytes, and must be at least 1, and always a power of 2.
The alignment of a value can be checked with the [`align_of_val`] function.

The *size* of a value is the offset in bytes between successive elements in an
array with that item type including alignment padding. The size of a value is
always a multiple of its alignment. Note that some types are zero-sized; 0 is
considered a multiple of any alignment (for example, on some platforms, the type
`[u16; 0]` has size 0 and alignment 2). The size of a value can be checked with
the [`size_of_val`] function.

Types where all values have the same size and alignment, and both are known at
compile time, implement the [`Sized`] trait and can be checked with the
[`size_of`] and [`align_of`] functions. Types that are not [`Sized`] are known
as [dynamically sized types]. Since all values of a `Sized` type share the same
size and alignment, we refer to those shared values as the size of the type and
the alignment of the type respectively.

## Primitive Data Layout

The size of most primitives is given in this table.

| Type              | `size_of::<Type>()`|
|--                 |--                  |
| `bool`            | 1                  |
| `u8` / `i8`       | 1                  |
| `u16` / `i16`     | 2                  |
| `u32` / `i32`     | 4                  |
| `u64` / `i64`     | 8                  |
| `u128` / `i128`   | 16                 |
| `f32`             | 4                  |
| `f64`             | 8                  |
| `char`            | 4                  |

`usize` and `isize` have a size big enough to contain every address on the
target platform. For example, on a 32 bit target, this is 4 bytes and on a 64
bit target, this is 8 bytes.

Most primitives are generally aligned to their size, although this is
platform-specific behavior. In particular, on x86 u64 and f64 are only
aligned to 32 bits.

## Pointers and References Layout

Pointers and references have the same layout. Mutability of the pointer or
reference does not change the layout.

Pointers to sized types have the same size and alignment as `usize`.

Pointers to unsized types are sized. The size and alignment is guaranteed to be
at least equal to the size and alignment of a pointer.

> Note: Though you should not rely on this, all pointers to
> <abbr title="Dynamically Sized Types">DSTs</abbr> are currently twice the
> size of the size of `usize` and have the same alignment.

## Array Layout

An array of `[T; N]` has a size of `size_of::<T>() * N` and the same alignment
of `T`. Arrays are laid out so that the zero-based `nth` element of the array
is offset from the start of the array by `n * size_of::<T>()` bytes.

## Slice Layout

Slices have the same layout as the section of the array they slice.

> Note: This is about the raw `[T]` type, not pointers (`&[T]`, `Box<[T]>`,
> etc.) to slices.

## `str` Layout
String slices are a UTF-8 representation of characters that have the same layout as slices of type `[u8]`.

## Tuple Layout

Tuples are laid out according to the [`Rust` representation][`Rust`].

The exception to this is the unit tuple (`()`), which is guaranteed as a
zero-sized type to have a size of 0 and an alignment of 1.

## Trait Object Layout

Trait objects have the same layout as the value the trait object is of.

> Note: This is about the raw trait object types, not pointers (`&dyn Trait`,
> `Box<dyn Trait>`, etc.) to trait objects.

## Closure Layout

Closures have no layout guarantees.

## Representations

All user-defined composite types (`struct`s, `enum`s, and `union`s) have a
*representation* that specifies what the layout is for the type. The possible
representations for a type are:

- [`Rust`] (default)
- [`C`]
- The [primitive representations]
- [`transparent`]

The representation of a type can be changed by applying the `repr` attribute
to it. The following example shows a struct with a `C` representation.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct ThreeInts {
    first: i16,
    second: i8,
    third: i32
}
```

The alignment may be raised or lowered with the `align` and `packed` modifiers
respectively. They alter the representation specified in the attribute.
If no representation is specified, the default one is altered.

```rust
// Default representation, alignment lowered to 2.
#[repr(packed(2))]
struct PackedStruct {
    first: i16,
    second: i8,
    third: i32
}

// C representation, alignment raised to 8
#[repr(C, align(8))]
struct AlignedStruct {
    first: i16,
    second: i8,
    third: i32
}
```

> Note: As a consequence of the representation being an attribute on the item,
> the representation does not depend on generic parameters. Any two types with
> the same name have the same representation. For example, `Foo<Bar>` and
> `Foo<Baz>` both have the same representation.

The representation of a type can change the padding between fields, but does
not change the layout of the fields themselves. For example, a struct with a
`C` representation that contains a struct `Inner` with the default
representation will not change the layout of `Inner`.

### <a id="the-default-representation"></a> The `Rust` Representation

The `Rust` representation is the default representation for nominal types
without a `repr` attribute. Using this representation explicitly through a
`repr` attribute is guaranteed to be the same as omitting the attribute
entirely.

The only data layout guarantees made by this representation are those required
for soundness. They are:

 1. The fields are properly aligned.
 2. The fields do not overlap.
 3. The alignment of the type is at least the maximum alignment of its fields.

Formally, the first guarantee means that the offset of any field is divisible by
that field's alignment. The second guarantee means that the fields can be
ordered such that the offset plus the size of any field is less than or equal to
the offset of the next field in the ordering. The ordering does not have to be
the same as the order in which the fields are specified in the declaration of
the type.

Be aware that the second guarantee does not imply that the fields have distinct
addresses: zero-sized types may have the same address as other fields in the
same struct.

There are no other guarantees of data layout made by this representation.

### The `C` Representation

The `C` representation is designed for dual purposes. One purpose is for
creating types that are interoperable with the C Language. The second purpose is
to create types that you can soundly perform operations on that rely on data
layout such as reinterpreting values as a different type.

Because of this dual purpose, it is possible to create types that are not useful
for interfacing with the C programming language.

This representation can be applied to structs, unions, and enums. The exception
is [zero-variant enums] for which the `C` representation is an error.

#### `#[repr(C)]` Structs

The alignment of the struct is the alignment of the most-aligned field in it.

The size and offset of fields is determined by the following algorithm.

Start with a current offset of 0 bytes.

For each field in declaration order in the struct, first determine the size and
alignment of the field. If the current offset is not a multiple of the field's
alignment, then add padding bytes to the current offset until it is a multiple
of the field's alignment. The offset for the field is what the current offset
is now. Then increase the current offset by the size of the field.

Finally, the size of the struct is the current offset rounded up to the nearest
multiple of the struct's alignment.

Here is this algorithm described in pseudocode.

<!-- ignore: pseudocode -->
```rust,ignore
/// Returns the amount of padding needed after `offset` to ensure that the
/// following address will be aligned to `alignment`.
fn padding_needed_for(offset: usize, alignment: usize) -> usize {
    let misalignment = offset % alignment;
    if misalignment > 0 {
        // round up to next multiple of `alignment`
        alignment - misalignment
    } else {
        // already a multiple of `alignment`
        0
    }
}

struct.alignment = struct.fields().map(|field| field.alignment).max();

let current_offset = 0;

for field in struct.fields_in_declaration_order() {
    // Increase the current offset so that it's a multiple of the alignment
    // of this field. For the first field, this will always be zero.
    // The skipped bytes are called padding bytes.
    current_offset += padding_needed_for(current_offset, field.alignment);

    struct[field].offset = current_offset;

    current_offset += field.size;
}

struct.size = current_offset + padding_needed_for(current_offset, struct.alignment);
```

Warning: This pseudocode uses a naive algorithm that ignores overflow issues for
the sake of clarity. To perform memory layout computations in actual code, use
[`Layout`].

#### `#[repr(C)]` Unions

A union declared with `#[repr(C)]` will have the same size and alignment as an
equivalent C union declaration in the C language for the target platform.
The union will have a size of the maximum size of all of its fields rounded to
its alignment, and an alignment of the maximum alignment of all of its fields.
These maximums may come from different fields.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
union Union {
    f1: u16,
    f2: [u8; 4],
}

assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Union>(), 4);  // From f2
assert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<Union>(), 2); // From f1

#[repr(C)]
union SizeRoundedUp {
   a: u32,
   b: [u16; 3],
}

assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<SizeRoundedUp>(), 8);  // Size of 6 from b,
                                                      // rounded up to 8 from
                                                      // alignment of a.
assert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<SizeRoundedUp>(), 4); // From a
```

#### `#[repr(C)]` Field-less Enums

For [field-less enums], the `C` representation has the size and alignment of
the default `enum` size and alignment for the target platform's C ABI.

> Note: The enum representation in C is implementation defined, so this is
> really a "best guess". In particular, this may be incorrect when the C code
> of interest is compiled with certain flags.

<div class="warning">

Warning: There are crucial differences between an `enum` in the C language and
Rust's [field-less enums] with this representation. An `enum` in C is
mostly a `typedef` plus some named constants; in other words, an object of an
`enum` type can hold any integer value. For example, this is often used for
bitflags in `C`. In contrast, Rust’s [field-less enums] can only legally hold
the discriminant values, everything else is [undefined behavior]. Therefore,
using a field-less enum in FFI to model a C `enum` is often wrong.

</div>

#### `#[repr(C)]` Enums With Fields

The representation of a `repr(C)` enum with fields is a `repr(C)` struct with
two fields, also called a "tagged union" in C:

- a `repr(C)` version of the enum with all fields removed ("the tag")
- a `repr(C)` union of `repr(C)` structs for the fields of each variant that had
  them ("the payload")

> Note: Due to the representation of `repr(C)` structs and unions, if a variant
> has a single field there is no difference between putting that field directly
> in the union or wrapping it in a struct; any system which wishes to manipulate
> such an `enum`'s representation may therefore use whichever form is more
> convenient or consistent for them.

```rust
// This Enum has the same representation as ...
#[repr(C)]
enum MyEnum {
    A(u32),
    B(f32, u64),
    C { x: u32, y: u8 },
    D,
 }

// ... this struct.
#[repr(C)]
struct MyEnumRepr {
    tag: MyEnumDiscriminant,
    payload: MyEnumFields,
}

// This is the discriminant enum.
#[repr(C)]
enum MyEnumDiscriminant { A, B, C, D }

// This is the variant union.
#[repr(C)]
union MyEnumFields {
    A: MyAFields,
    B: MyBFields,
    C: MyCFields,
    D: MyDFields,
}

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct MyAFields(u32);

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct MyBFields(f32, u64);

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct MyCFields { x: u32, y: u8 }

// This struct could be omitted (it is a zero-sized type), and it must be in
// C/C++ headers.
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct MyDFields;
```

> Note: `union`s with non-`Copy` fields are unstable, see [55149].

### Primitive representations

The *primitive representations* are the representations with the same names as
the primitive integer types. That is: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`,
`usize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, and `isize`.

Primitive representations can only be applied to enumerations and have
different behavior whether the enum has fields or no fields. It is an error
for [zero-variant enums] to have a primitive representation. Combining
two primitive representations together is an error.

#### Primitive Representation of Field-less Enums

For [field-less enums], primitive representations set the size and alignment to
be the same as the primitive type of the same name. For example, a field-less
enum with a `u8` representation can only have discriminants between 0 and 255
inclusive.

#### Primitive Representation of Enums With Fields

The representation of a primitive representation enum is a `repr(C)` union of
`repr(C)` structs for each variant with a field. The first field of each struct
in the union is the primitive representation version of the enum with all fields
removed ("the tag") and the remaining fields are the fields of that variant.

> Note: This representation is unchanged if the tag is given its own member in
> the union, should that make manipulation more clear for you (although to
> follow the C++ standard the tag member should be wrapped in a `struct`).

```rust
// This enum has the same representation as ...
#[repr(u8)]
enum MyEnum {
    A(u32),
    B(f32, u64),
    C { x: u32, y: u8 },
    D,
 }

// ... this union.
#[repr(C)]
union MyEnumRepr {
    A: MyVariantA,
    B: MyVariantB,
    C: MyVariantC,
    D: MyVariantD,
}

// This is the discriminant enum.
#[repr(u8)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
enum MyEnumDiscriminant { A, B, C, D }

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct MyVariantA(MyEnumDiscriminant, u32);

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct MyVariantB(MyEnumDiscriminant, f32, u64);

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct MyVariantC { tag: MyEnumDiscriminant, x: u32, y: u8 }

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct MyVariantD(MyEnumDiscriminant);
```

> Note: `union`s with non-`Copy` fields are unstable, see [55149].

#### Combining primitive representations of enums with fields and `#[repr(C)]`

For enums with fields, it is also possible to combine `repr(C)` and a
primitive representation (e.g., `repr(C, u8)`). This modifies the [`repr(C)`] by
changing the representation of the discriminant enum to the chosen primitive
instead. So, if you chose the `u8` representation, then the discriminant enum
would have a size and alignment of 1 byte.

The discriminant enum from the example [earlier][`repr(C)`] then becomes:

```rust
#[repr(C, u8)] // `u8` was added
enum MyEnum {
    A(u32),
    B(f32, u64),
    C { x: u32, y: u8 },
    D,
 }

// ...

#[repr(u8)] // So `u8` is used here instead of `C`
enum MyEnumDiscriminant { A, B, C, D }

// ...
```

For example, with a `repr(C, u8)` enum it is not possible to have 257 unique
discriminants ("tags") whereas the same enum with only a `repr(C)` attribute
will compile without any problems.

Using a primitive representation in addition to `repr(C)` can change the size of
an enum from the `repr(C)` form:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
enum EnumC {
    Variant0(u8),
    Variant1,
}

#[repr(C, u8)]
enum Enum8 {
    Variant0(u8),
    Variant1,
}

#[repr(C, u16)]
enum Enum16 {
    Variant0(u8),
    Variant1,
}

// The size of the C representation is platform dependant
assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<EnumC>(), 8);
// One byte for the discriminant and one byte for the value in Enum8::Variant0
assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Enum8>(), 2);
// Two bytes for the discriminant and one byte for the value in Enum16::Variant0
// plus one byte of padding.
assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Enum16>(), 4);
```

[`repr(C)`]: #reprc-enums-with-fields

### The alignment modifiers

The `align` and `packed` modifiers can be used to respectively raise or lower
the alignment of `struct`s and `union`s. `packed` may also alter the padding
between fields (although it will not alter the padding inside of any field).
On their own, `align` and `packed` do not provide guarantees about the order
of fields in the layout of a struct or the layout of an enum variant, although
they may be combined with representations (such as `C`) which do provide such
guarantees.

The alignment is specified as an integer parameter in the form of
`#[repr(align(x))]` or `#[repr(packed(x))]`. The alignment value must be a
power of two from 1 up to 2<sup>29</sup>. For `packed`, if no value is given,
as in `#[repr(packed)]`, then the value is 1.

For `align`, if the specified alignment is less than the alignment of the type
without the `align` modifier, then the alignment is unaffected.

For `packed`, if the specified alignment is greater than the type's alignment
without the `packed` modifier, then the alignment and layout is unaffected.
The alignments of each field, for the purpose of positioning fields, is the
smaller of the specified alignment and the alignment of the field's type.
Inter-field padding is guaranteed to be the minimum required in order to
satisfy each field's (possibly altered) alignment (although note that, on its
own, `packed` does not provide any guarantee about field ordering). An
important consequence of these rules is that a type with `#[repr(packed(1))]`
(or `#[repr(packed)]`) will have no inter-field padding.

The `align` and `packed` modifiers cannot be applied on the same type and a
`packed` type cannot transitively contain another `align`ed type. `align` and
`packed` may only be applied to the [`Rust`] and [`C`] representations.

The `align` modifier can also be applied on an `enum`.
When it is, the effect on the `enum`'s alignment is the same as if the `enum`
was wrapped in a newtype `struct` with the same `align` modifier.

> Note: References to unaligned fields are not allowed because it is [undefined behavior].
> When fields are unaligned due to an alignment modifier, consider the following options for using references and dereferences:
>
> ```rust
> #[repr(packed)]
> struct Packed {
>     f1: u8,
>     f2: u16,
> }
> let mut e = Packed { f1: 1, f2: 2 };
> // Instead of creating a reference to a field, copy the value to a local variable.
> let x = e.f2;
> // Or in situations like `println!` which creates a reference, use braces
> // to change it to a copy of the value.
> println!("{}", {e.f2});
> // Or if you need a pointer, use the unaligned methods for reading and writing
> // instead of dereferencing the pointer directly.
> let ptr: *const u16 = std::ptr::addr_of!(e.f2);
> let value = unsafe { ptr.read_unaligned() };
> let mut_ptr: *mut u16 = std::ptr::addr_of_mut!(e.f2);
> unsafe { mut_ptr.write_unaligned(3) }
> ```

### The `transparent` Representation

The `transparent` representation can only be used on a [`struct`][structs]
or an [`enum`][enumerations] with a single variant that has:

- a single field with non-zero size, and
- any number of fields with size 0 and alignment 1 (e.g. [`PhantomData<T>`]).

Structs and enums with this representation have the same layout and ABI
as the single non-zero sized field.

This is different than the `C` representation because
a struct with the `C` representation will always have the ABI of a `C` `struct`
while, for example, a struct with the `transparent` representation with a
primitive field will have the ABI of the primitive field.

Because this representation delegates type layout to another type, it cannot be
used with any other representation.
