# Code generation attributes

The following [attributes] are used for controlling code generation.

## Optimization hints

The `cold` and `inline` [attributes] give suggestions to generate code in a
way that may be faster than what it would do without the hint. The attributes
are only hints, and may be ignored.

Both attributes can be used on [functions]. When applied to a function in a
[trait], they apply only to that function when used as a default function for
a trait implementation and not to all trait implementations. The attributes
have no effect on a trait function without a body.

### The `inline` attribute

The *`inline` [attribute]* suggests that a copy of the attributed function
should be placed in the caller, rather than generating code to call the
function where it is defined.

> ***Note***: The `rustc` compiler automatically inlines functions based on
> internal heuristics. Incorrectly inlining functions can make the program
> slower, so this attribute should be used with care.

There are three ways to use the inline attribute:

* `#[inline]` *suggests* performing an inline expansion.
* `#[inline(always)]` *suggests* that an inline expansion should always be
  performed.
* `#[inline(never)]` *suggests* that an inline expansion should never be
  performed.

> ***Note***: `#[inline]` in every form is a hint, with no *requirements*
> on the language to place a copy of the attributed function in the caller.

### The `cold` attribute

The *`cold` [attribute]* suggests that the attributed function is unlikely to
be called.

## The `no_builtins` attribute

The *`no_builtins` [attribute]* may be applied at the crate level to disable
optimizing certain code patterns to invocations of library functions that are
assumed to exist.

## The `target_feature` attribute

The *`target_feature` [attribute]* may be applied to a function to
enable code generation of that function for specific platform architecture
features. It uses the [_MetaListNameValueStr_] syntax with a single key of
`enable` whose value is a string of comma-separated feature names to enable.

```rust
# #[cfg(target_feature = "avx2")]
#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]
unsafe fn foo_avx2() {}
```

Each [target architecture] has a set of features that may be enabled. It is an
error to specify a feature for a target architecture that the crate is not
being compiled for.

It is [undefined behavior] to call a function that is compiled with a feature
that is not supported on the current platform the code is running on, *except*
if the platform explicitly documents this to be safe.

Functions marked with `target_feature` are not inlined into a context that
does not support the given features. The `#[inline(always)]` attribute may not
be used with a `target_feature` attribute.

### Available features

The following is a list of the available feature names.

#### `x86` or `x86_64`

Executing code with unsupported features is undefined behavior on this platform.
Hence this platform requires that `#[target_feature]` is only applied to [`unsafe`
functions][unsafe function].

#### `wasm32` or `wasm64`

`#[target_feature]` may be used with both safe and
[`unsafe` functions][unsafe function] on Wasm platforms. It is impossible to
cause undefined behavior via the `#[target_feature]` attribute because
attempting to use instructions unsupported by the Wasm engine will fail at load
time without the risk of being interpreted in a way different from what the
compiler expected.

### Additional information

See the [`target_feature` conditional compilation option] for selectively
enabling or disabling compilation of code based on compile-time settings. Note
that this option is not affected by the `target_feature` attribute, and is
only driven by the features enabled for the entire crate.

See the [`is_x86_feature_detected`] or [`is_aarch64_feature_detected`] macros
in the standard library for runtime feature detection on these platforms.

> Note: `rustc` has a default set of features enabled for each target and CPU.
> The CPU may be chosen with the [`-C target-cpu`] flag. Individual features
> may be enabled or disabled for an entire crate with the
> [`-C target-feature`] flag.

## The `track_caller` attribute

The `track_caller` attribute may be applied to any function with [`"Rust"` ABI][rust-abi]
with the exception of the entry point `fn main`. When applied to functions and methods in
trait declarations, the attribute applies to all implementations. If the trait provides a
default implementation with the attribute, then the attribute also applies to override implementations.

When applied to a function in an `extern` block the attribute must also be applied to any linked
implementations, otherwise undefined behavior results. When applied to a function which is made
available to an `extern` block, the declaration in the `extern` block must also have the attribute,
otherwise undefined behavior results.

### Behavior

Applying the attribute to a function `f` allows code within `f` to get a hint of the [`Location`] of
the "topmost" tracked call that led to `f`'s invocation. At the point of observation, an
implementation behaves as if it walks up the stack from `f`'s frame to find the nearest frame of an
*unattributed* function `outer`, and it returns the [`Location`] of the tracked call in `outer`.

```rust
#[track_caller]
fn f() {
    println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
}
```

> Note: `core` provides [`core::panic::Location::caller`] for observing caller locations. It wraps
> the [`core::intrinsics::caller_location`] intrinsic implemented by `rustc`.

> Note: because the resulting `Location` is a hint, an implementation may halt its walk up the stack
> early. See [Limitations](#limitations) for important caveats.

#### Examples

When `f` is called directly by `calls_f`, code in `f` observes its callsite within `calls_f`:

```rust
# #[track_caller]
# fn f() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
# }
fn calls_f() {
    f(); // <-- f() prints this location
}
```

When `f` is called by another attributed function `g` which is in turn called by `calls_g`, code in
both `f` and `g` observes `g`'s callsite within `calls_g`:

```rust
# #[track_caller]
# fn f() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
# }
#[track_caller]
fn g() {
    println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
    f();
}

fn calls_g() {
    g(); // <-- g() prints this location twice, once itself and once from f()
}
```

When `g` is called by another attributed function `h` which is in turn called by `calls_h`, all code
in `f`, `g`, and `h` observes `h`'s callsite within `calls_h`:

```rust
# #[track_caller]
# fn f() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
# }
# #[track_caller]
# fn g() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
#     f();
# }
#[track_caller]
fn h() {
    println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
    g();
}

fn calls_h() {
    h(); // <-- prints this location three times, once itself, once from g(), once from f()
}
```

And so on.

### Limitations

This information is a hint and implementations are not required to preserve it.

In particular, coercing a function with `#[track_caller]` to a function pointer creates a shim which
appears to observers to have been called at the attributed function's definition site, losing actual
caller information across virtual calls. A common example of this coercion is the creation of a
trait object whose methods are attributed.

> Note: The aforementioned shim for function pointers is necessary because `rustc` implements
> `track_caller` in a codegen context by appending an implicit parameter to the function ABI, but
> this would be unsound for an indirect call because the parameter is not a part of the function's
> type and a given function pointer type may or may not refer to a function with the attribute. The
> creation of a shim hides the implicit parameter from callers of the function pointer, preserving
> soundness.

## The `instruction_set` attribute

The *`instruction_set` attribute* may be applied to a function to enable code generation for a specific
instruction set supported by the target architecture. It uses the [_MetaListPath_] syntax and a path
comprised of the architecture and instruction set to specify how to generate the code for
architectures where a single program may utilize multiple instruction sets.

The following values are available on targets for the `ARMv4` and `ARMv5te` architectures:

* `arm::a32` - Uses ARM code.
* `arm::t32` - Uses Thumb code.

<!-- ignore: arm-only -->
