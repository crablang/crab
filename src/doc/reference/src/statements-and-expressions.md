# Statements and expressions

Rust is _primarily_ an expression language.
This means that most forms of value-producing or effect-causing evaluation are directed by the uniform syntax category of _expressions_.
Each kind of expression can typically _nest_ within each other kind of expression, and rules for evaluation of expressions involve specifying both the value produced by the expression and the order in which its sub-expressions are themselves evaluated.

In contrast, statements serve _mostly_ to contain and explicitly sequence expression evaluation.
