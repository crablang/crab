# Introduction

Welcome to The Rust Edition Guide! "Editions" are Rust's way of introducing
changes into the language that would not otherwise be backwards
compatible.

In this guide, we'll discuss:

* What editions are
* Which changes are contained in each edition
* How to migrate your code from one edition to another
