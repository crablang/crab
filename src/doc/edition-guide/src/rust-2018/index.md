| RFC | [#2052](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2052-epochs.html), which also proposed the Edition system |
| Release version | [1.31.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html) |

The edition system was created for the release of Rust 2018. The release of the Rust 2018 edition coincided with a number of other features all coordinated around the theme of *productivity*. The majority of those features were backwards compatible and are now available on all editions; however, some of those changes required the edition mechanism (most notably the [module system changes](path-changes.md)).
