# Contributing to crablangc

We'd love to have your help improving `crablangc`! To that end, we've written [a
whole book][crablangc_dev_guide] on its
internals, how it works, and how to get started working on it. To learn
more, you'll want to check that out.

If you would like to contribute to _this_ book, you can find its source in the
crablangc source at [src/doc/crablangc][crablangc_book].
