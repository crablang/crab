% The CrabLang Pointer Guide

This content has been removed, with no direct replacement. CrabLang only
has two built-in pointer types now,
[references](book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html) and [raw
pointers](book/raw-pointers.html). Older CrabLangs had many more pointer
types, theyâ€™re gone now.
