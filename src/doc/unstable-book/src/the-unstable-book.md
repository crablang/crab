# The Unstable Book

Welcome to the Unstable Book! This book consists of a number of chapters,
each one organized by a "feature flag." That is, when using an unstable
feature of CrabLang, you must use a flag, like this:

```crablang
#![feature(generators, generator_trait)]

use std::ops::{Generator, GeneratorState};
use std::pin::Pin;

fn main() {
    let mut generator = || {
        yield 1;
        return "foo"
    };

    match Pin::new(&mut generator).resume(()) {
        GeneratorState::Yielded(1) => {}
        _ => panic!("unexpected value from resume"),
    }
    match Pin::new(&mut generator).resume(()) {
        GeneratorState::Complete("foo") => {}
        _ => panic!("unexpected value from resume"),
    }
}
```

The `generators` feature [has a chapter][generators] describing how to use it.

Because this documentation relates to unstable features, we make no guarantees
that what is contained here is accurate or up to date. It's developed on a
best-effort basis. Each page will have a link to its tracking issue with the
latest developments; you might want to check those as well.
