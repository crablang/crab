# `sanitizer`

The tracking issues for this feature are:

* [#39699](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/39699).
* [#89653](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/89653).

------------------------

This feature allows for use of one of following sanitizers:

* [AddressSanitizer](#addresssanitizer) a fast memory error detector.
* [ControlFlowIntegrity](#controlflowintegrity) LLVM Control Flow Integrity (CFI) provides
  forward-edge control flow protection.
* [HWAddressSanitizer](#hwaddresssanitizer) a memory error detector similar to
  AddressSanitizer, but based on partial hardware assistance.
* [KernelControlFlowIntegrity](#kernelcontrolflowintegrity) LLVM Kernel Control
  Flow Integrity (KCFI) provides forward-edge control flow protection for
  operating systems kernels.
* [LeakSanitizer](#leaksanitizer) a run-time memory leak detector.
* [MemorySanitizer](#memorysanitizer) a detector of uninitialized reads.
* [MemTagSanitizer](#memtagsanitizer) fast memory error detector based on
  Armv8.5-A Memory Tagging Extension.
* [ShadowCallStack](#shadowcallstack) provides backward-edge control flow protection.
* [ThreadSanitizer](#threadsanitizer) a fast data race detector.

To enable a sanitizer compile with `-Zsanitizer=address`,`-Zsanitizer=cfi`,
`-Zsanitizer=hwaddress`, `-Zsanitizer=leak`, `-Zsanitizer=memory`,
`-Zsanitizer=memtag`, `-Zsanitizer=shadow-call-stack`, or `-Zsanitizer=thread`.
You might also need the `--target` and `build-std` flags. Example:
```shell
$ CRABLANGFLAGS=-Zsanitizer=address cargo build -Zbuild-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

# AddressSanitizer

AddressSanitizer is a memory error detector. It can detect the following types
of bugs:

* Out of bound accesses to heap, stack and globals
* Use after free
* Use after return (runtime flag `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1`)
* Use after scope
* Double-free, invalid free
* Memory leaks

The memory leak detection is enabled by default on Linux, and can be enabled
with runtime flag `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1` on macOS.

AddressSanitizer is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-apple-darwin`
* `aarch64-unknown-fuchsia`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
* `x86_64-unknown-fuchsia`
* `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

AddressSanitizer works with non-instrumented code although it will impede its
ability to detect some bugs.  It is not expected to produce false positive
reports.

See the [Clang AddressSanitizer documentation][clang-asan] for more details.

# ControlFlowIntegrity

The LLVM Control Flow Integrity (CFI) support in the CrabLang compiler initially
provides forward-edge control flow protection for CrabLang-compiled code only by
aggregating function pointers in groups identified by their return and parameter
types.

Forward-edge control flow protection for C or C++ and CrabLang -compiled code "mixed
binaries" (i.e., for when C or C++ and CrabLang -compiled code share the same
virtual address space) will be provided in later work by defining and using
compatible type identifiers (see Type metadata in the design document in the
tracking issue [#89653](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/89653)).

LLVM CFI can be enabled with -Zsanitizer=cfi and requires LTO (i.e., -Clto).

See the [Clang ControlFlowIntegrity documentation][clang-cfi] for more details.

## Example

```crablang,ignore (making doc tests pass cross-platform is hard)
#![feature(naked_functions)]

use std::arch::asm;
use std::mem;

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[naked]
pub extern "C" fn add_two(x: i32) {
    // x + 2 preceded by a landing pad/nop block
    unsafe {
        asm!(
            "
             nop
             nop
             nop
             nop
             nop
             nop
             nop
             nop
             nop
             lea eax, [edi+2]
             ret
        ",
            options(noreturn)
        );
    }
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);

    println!("The answer is: {}", answer);

    println!("With CFI enabled, you should not see the next answer");
    let f: fn(i32) -> i32 = unsafe {
        // Offsets 0-8 make it land in the landing pad/nop block, and offsets 1-8 are
        // invalid branch/call destinations (i.e., within the body of the function).
        mem::transmute::<*const u8, fn(i32) -> i32>((add_two as *const u8).offset(5))
    };
    let next_answer = do_twice(f, 5);

    println!("The next answer is: {}", next_answer);
}
```

# HWAddressSanitizer

HWAddressSanitizer is a newer variant of AddressSanitizer that consumes much
less memory.

HWAddressSanitizer is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-linux-android`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`

HWAddressSanitizer requires `tagged-globals` target feature to instrument
globals. To enable this target feature compile with `-C
target-feature=+tagged-globals`

See the [Clang HWAddressSanitizer documentation][clang-hwasan] for more details.

## Example

Heap buffer overflow:

```crablang
fn main() {
    let xs = vec![0, 1, 2, 3];
    let _y = unsafe { *xs.as_ptr().offset(4) };
}
```

```shell
$ crablangc main.rs -Zsanitizer=hwaddress -C target-feature=+tagged-globals -C
linker=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld --target
aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

```shell

SUMMARY: HWAddressSanitizer: tag-mismatch (/.../main+0x54a94)
```

# KernelControlFlowIntegrity

The LLVM Kernel Control Flow Integrity (CFI) support to the CrabLang compiler
initially provides forward-edge control flow protection for operating systems
kernels for CrabLang-compiled code only by aggregating function pointers in groups
identified by their return and parameter types. (See [LLVM commit cff5bef "KCFI
sanitizer"](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/cff5bef948c91e4919de8a5fb9765e0edc13f3de).)

Forward-edge control flow protection for C or C++ and CrabLang -compiled code "mixed
binaries" (i.e., for when C or C++ and CrabLang -compiled code share the same
virtual address space) will be provided in later work by defining and using
compatible type identifiers (see Type metadata in the design document in the
tracking issue [#89653](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/89653)).

LLVM KCFI can be enabled with `-Zsanitizer=kcfi`.

LLVM KCFI is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-linux-android`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-linux-android`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

See the [Clang KernelControlFlowIntegrity documentation][clang-kcfi] for more
details.

# KernelAddressSanitizer

KernelAddressSanitizer (KASAN) is a freestanding version of AddressSanitizer
which is suitable for detecting memory errors in programs which do not have a
runtime environment, such as operating system kernels. KernelAddressSanitizer
requires manual implementation of the underlying functions used for tracking
KernelAddressSanitizer state.

KernelAddressSanitizer is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-unknown-none`
* `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`
* `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`
* `x86_64-unknown-none`

See the [Linux Kernel's KernelAddressSanitizer documentation][linux-kasan] for
more details.

# LeakSanitizer

LeakSanitizer is run-time memory leak detector.

LeakSanitizer is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-apple-darwin`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

See the [Clang LeakSanitizer documentation][clang-lsan] for more details.

# MemorySanitizer

MemorySanitizer is detector of uninitialized reads.

MemorySanitizer is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

MemorySanitizer requires all program code to be instrumented. C/C++ dependencies
need to be recompiled using Clang with `-fsanitize=memory` option. Failing to
achieve that will result in false positive reports.

See the [Clang MemorySanitizer documentation][clang-msan] for more details.

## Example

Detecting the use of uninitialized memory. The `-Zbuild-std` flag rebuilds and
instruments the standard library, and is strictly necessary for the correct
operation of the tool. The `-Zsanitizer-memory-track-origins` enables tracking
of the origins of uninitialized memory:

```crablang
use std::mem::MaybeUninit;

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        let a = MaybeUninit::<[usize; 4]>::uninit();
        let a = a.assume_init();
        println!("{}", a[2]);
    }
}
```

```shell
$ export \
  CRABLANGFLAGS='-Zsanitizer=memory -Zsanitizer-memory-track-origins' \
  CRABLANGDOCFLAGS='-Zsanitizer=memory -Zsanitizer-memory-track-origins'
$ cargo clean
$ cargo run -Zbuild-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

```

# MemTagSanitizer

MemTagSanitizer detects a similar class of errors as AddressSanitizer and HardwareAddressSanitizer, but with lower overhead suitable for use as hardening for production binaries.

MemTagSanitizer is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-linux-android`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`

MemTagSanitizer requires hardware support and the `mte` target feature.
To enable this target feature compile with `-C target-feature="+mte"`.

See the [LLVM MemTagSanitizer documentation][llvm-memtag] for more details.

# ShadowCallStack

ShadowCallStack provides backward edge control flow protection by storing a function's return address in a separately allocated 'shadow call stack' and loading the return address from that shadow call stack.

ShadowCallStack requires a platform ABI which reserves `x18` as the instrumentation makes use of this register.

ShadowCallStack can be enabled with `-Zsanitizer=shadow-call-stack` option and is supported on the following targets:

* `aarch64-linux-android`

A runtime must be provided by the application or operating system.

See the [Clang ShadowCallStack documentation][clang-scs] for more details.

# ThreadSanitizer

ThreadSanitizer is a data race detection tool. It is supported on the following
targets:

* `aarch64-apple-darwin`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
* `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

To work correctly ThreadSanitizer needs to be "aware" of all synchronization
operations in a program. It generally achieves that through combination of
library interception (for example synchronization performed through
`pthread_mutex_lock` / `pthread_mutex_unlock`) and compile time instrumentation
(e.g. atomic operations). Using it without instrumenting all the program code
can lead to false positive reports.

ThreadSanitizer does not support atomic fences `std::sync::atomic::fence`,
nor synchronization performed using inline assembly code.

See the [Clang ThreadSanitizer documentation][clang-tsan] for more details.

## Example

```crablang
static mut A: usize = 0;

fn main() {
    let t = std::thread::spawn(|| {
        unsafe { A += 1 };
    });
    unsafe { A += 1 };

    t.join().unwrap();
}
```

```shell
$ export CRABLANGFLAGS=-Zsanitizer=thread CRABLANGDOCFLAGS=-Zsanitizer=thread
$ cargo run -Zbuild-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Instrumentation of external dependencies and std

The sanitizers to varying degrees work correctly with partially instrumented
code. On the one extreme is LeakSanitizer that doesn't use any compile time
instrumentation, on the other is MemorySanitizer that requires that all program
code to be instrumented (failing to achieve that will inevitably result in
false positives).

It is strongly recommended to combine sanitizers with recompiled and
instrumented standard library, for example using [cargo `-Zbuild-std`
functionality][build-std].

[build-std]: ../../cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std

# Build scripts and procedural macros

Use of sanitizers together with build scripts and procedural macros is
technically possible, but in almost all cases it would be best avoided.  This
is especially true for procedural macros which would require an instrumented
version of crablangc.

In more practical terms when using cargo always remember to pass `--target`
flag, so that crablangflags will not be applied to build scripts and procedural
macros.

# Symbolizing the Reports

Sanitizers produce symbolized stacktraces when llvm-symbolizer binary is in `PATH`.
