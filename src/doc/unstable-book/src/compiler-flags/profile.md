# `profile`

The tracking issue for this feature is: [#42524](https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/42524).

------------------------

This feature allows the generation of code coverage reports.

Set the `-Zprofile` compiler flag in order to enable gcov profiling.

For example:
```Bash
cargo new testgcov --bin
cd testgcov
export CRABLANGFLAGS="-Zprofile -Ccodegen-units=1 -Copt-level=0 -Clink-dead-code -Coverflow-checks=off -Zpanic_abort_tests -Cpanic=abort"
export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0
cargo build
cargo run
```

Once you've built and run your program, files with the `gcno` (after build) and `gcda` (after execution) extensions will be created.
You can parse them with [llvm-cov gcov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-gcov) or [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov).

Please note that `CRABLANGFLAGS` by default applies to everything that cargo builds and runs during a build!
When the `--target` flag is explicitly passed to cargo, the `CRABLANGFLAGS` no longer apply to build scripts and procedural macros.
For more fine-grained control consider passing a `CRABLANGC_WRAPPER` program to cargo that only adds the profiling flags to
crablangc for the specific crates you want to profile.
