# References

There are two kinds of reference:

* Shared reference: `&`
* Mutable reference: `&mut`

Which obey the following rules:

* A reference cannot outlive its referent
* A mutable reference cannot be aliased

That's it. That's the whole model references follow.

Of course, we should probably define what *aliased* means.

```text
error[E0425]: cannot find value `aliased` in this scope
 --> <rust.rs>:2:20
  |
2 |     println!("{}", aliased);
  |                    ^^^^^^^ not found in this scope

error: aborting due to previous error
```

Unfortunately, Rust hasn't actually defined its aliasing model. ðŸ™€

While we wait for the Rust devs to specify the semantics of their language,
let's use the next section to discuss what aliasing is in general, and why it
matters.
