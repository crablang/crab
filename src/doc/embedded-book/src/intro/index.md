# Introduction

Welcome to The Embedded Rust Book: An introductory book about using the Rust
Programming Language on "Bare Metal" embedded systems, such as Microcontrollers.

## Who Embedded Rust is For
Embedded Rust is for everyone who wants to do embedded programming while taking advantage of the higher-level concepts and safety guarantees the Rust language provides.
(See also [Who Rust Is For](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html))

## Scope

The goals of this book are:

* Get developers up to speed with embedded Rust development. i.e. How to set
  up a development environment.

* Share *current* best practices about using Rust for embedded development. i.e.
  How to best use Rust language features to write more correct embedded
  software.

* Serve as a cookbook in some cases. e.g. How do I mix C and Rust in a single
  project?

This book tries to be as general as possible but to make things easier for both
the readers and the writers it uses the ARM Cortex-M architecture in all its
examples. However, the book doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with this
particular architecture and explains details particular to this architecture
where required.

## Who This Book is For
This book caters towards people with either some embedded background or some Rust background, however we believe
everybody curious about embedded Rust programming can get something out of this book. For those without any prior knowledge
we suggest you read the "Assumptions and Prerequisites" section and catch up on missing knowledge to get more out of the book
and improve your reading experience. You can check out the "Other Resources" section to find resources on topics
you might want to catch up on.

### Assumptions and Prerequisites

* You are comfortable using the Rust Programming Language, and have written,
  run, and debugged Rust applications on a desktop environment. You should also
  be familiar with the idioms of the [2018 edition] as this book targets
  Rust 2018.

[2018 edition]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/

* You are comfortable developing and debugging embedded systems in another
  language such as C, C++, or Ada, and are familiar with concepts such as:
    * Cross Compilation
    * Memory Mapped Peripherals
    * Interrupts
    * Common interfaces such as I2C, SPI, Serial, etc.

## How to Use This Book

This book generally assumes that youâ€™re reading it front-to-back. Later
chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters may
not dig into details on a topic, revisiting the topic in a later chapter.

This book will be using the [STM32F3DISCOVERY] development board from
STMicroelectronics for the majority of the examples contained within. This board
is based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture, and while basic functionality is
the same across most CPUs based on this architecture, peripherals and other
implementation details of Microcontrollers are different between different
vendors, and often even different between Microcontroller families from the same
vendor.

For this reason, we suggest purchasing the [STM32F3DISCOVERY] development board
for the purpose of following the examples in this book.
