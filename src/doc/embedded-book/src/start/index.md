# Getting Started

In this section we'll walk you through the process of writing, building,
flashing and debugging embedded programs. You will be able to try most of the
examples without any special hardware as we will show you the basics using
QEMU, a popular open-source hardware emulator. The only section where hardware
is required is, naturally enough, the [Hardware](./hardware.md) section,
where we use OpenOCD to program an [STM32F3DISCOVERY].
