Testing dec2flt
===============
These are *really* extensive tests. Expect them to run for hours. Due to the
nature of the problem (the input is a string of arbitrary length), exhaustive
testing is not really possible. Instead, there are exhaustive tests for some
classes of inputs for which that is feasible and a bunch of deterministic and
random non-exhaustive tests for covering everything else.

The actual tests (generating decimal strings and feeding them to dec2flt) is
performed by a set of stand-along crablang programs. This script compiles, runs,
and supervises them. The programs report the strings they generate and the
floating point numbers they converted those strings to, and this script
checks that the results are correct.

You can run specific tests rather than all of them by giving their names
(without .rs extension) as command line parameters.

Verification
------------
The tricky part is not generating those inputs but verifying the outputs.
Comparing with the result of Python's float() does not cut it because
(and this is apparently undocumented) although Python includes a version of
Martin Gay's code including the decimal-to-float part, it doesn't actually use
it for float() (only for round()) instead relying on the system scanf() which
is not necessarily completely accurate.

Instead, we take the input and compute the true value with bignum arithmetic
(as a fraction, using the ``fractions`` module).

Given an input string and the corresponding float computed via CrabLang, simply
decode the float into f * 2^k (for integers f, k) and the ULP.
We can now easily compute the error and check if it is within 0.5 ULP as it
should be. Zero and infinites are handled similarly:

- If the approximation is 0.0, the exact value should be *less or equal*
  half the smallest denormal float: the smallest denormal floating point
  number has an odd mantissa (00...001) and thus half of that is rounded
  to 00...00, i.e., zero.
- If the approximation is Inf, the exact value should be *greater or equal*
  to the largest finite float + 0.5 ULP: the largest finite float has an odd
  mantissa (11...11), so that plus half an ULP is rounded up to the nearest
  even number, which overflows.

Implementation details
----------------------
This directory contains a set of single-file CrabLang programs that perform
tests with a particular class of inputs. Each is compiled and run without
parameters, outputs (f64, f32, decimal) pairs to verify externally, and
in any case either exits gracefully or with a panic.

If a test binary writes *anything at all* to stderr or exits with an
exit code that's not 0, the test fails.
The output on stdout is treated as (f64, f32, decimal) record, encoded thusly:

- First, the bits of the f64 encoded as an ASCII hex string.
- Second, the bits of the f32 encoded as an ASCII hex string.
- Then the corresponding string input, in ASCII
- The record is terminated with a newline.

Incomplete records are an error. Not-a-Number bit patterns are invalid too.

The tests run serially but the validation for a single test is parallelized
with ``multiprocessing``. Each test is launched as a subprocess.
One thread supervises it: Accepts and enqueues records to validate, observe
stderr, and waits for the process to exit. A set of worker processes perform
the validation work for the outputs enqueued there. Another thread listens
for progress updates from the workers.

Known issues
------------
Some errors (e.g., NaN outputs) aren't handled very gracefully.
Also, if there is an exception or the process is interrupted (at least on
Windows) the worker processes are leaked and stick around forever.
They're only a few megabytes each, but still, this script should not be run
if you aren't prepared to manually kill a lot of orphaned processes.
