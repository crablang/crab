    /// ```
    /// #![feature(unsized_locals, unsized_fn_params)]
    /// # use core::fmt::Debug;
    /// fn foo(p: dyn Debug) { dbg!(p); }
    ///
    /// fn bar(box_p: Box<dyn Debug>) { foo(*box_p); }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Ordinarily, for sized types, we would compile the call `foo(*p)` like so:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// let tmp0 = *box_p; // tmp0 would be the operand returned by this function call
    /// foo(tmp0)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// But because the parameter to `foo` is of the unsized type `dyn Debug`, and because it is
    /// being moved the deref of a box, we compile it slightly differently. The temporary `tmp0`
    /// that we create *stores the entire box*, and the parameter to the call itself will be
    /// `*tmp0`:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// let tmp0 = box_p; call foo(*tmp0)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This way, the temporary `tmp0` that we create has type `Box<dyn Debug>`, which is sized.
    /// The value passed to the call (`*tmp0`) still has the `dyn Debug` type -- but the way that
    /// calls are compiled means that this parameter will be passed "by reference", meaning that we
    /// will actually provide a pointer to the interior of the box, and not move the `dyn Debug`
    /// value to the stack.
    ///
    /// See #68304 for more details.
