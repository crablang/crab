//! This module defines the `DepNode` type which the compiler uses to represent
//! nodes in the dependency graph. A `DepNode` consists of a `DepKind` (which
//! specifies the kind of thing it represents, like a piece of HIR, MIR, etc)
//! and a `Fingerprint`, a 128 bit hash value the exact meaning of which
//! depends on the node's `DepKind`. Together, the kind and the fingerprint
//! fully identify a dependency node, even across multiple compilation sessions.
//! In other words, the value of the fingerprint does not depend on anything
//! that is specific to a given compilation session, like an unpredictable
//! interning key (e.g., NodeId, DefId, Symbol) or the numeric value of a
//! pointer. The concept behind this could be compared to how git commit hashes
//! uniquely identify a given commit and has a few advantages:
//!
//! * A `DepNode` can simply be serialized to disk and loaded in another session
//!   without the need to do any "rebasing (like we have to do for Spans and
//!   NodeIds) or "retracing" like we had to do for `DefId` in earlier
//!   implementations of the dependency graph.
//! * A `Fingerprint` is just a bunch of bits, which allows `DepNode` to
//!   implement `Copy`, `Sync`, `Send`, `Freeze`, etc.
//! * Since we just have a bit pattern, `DepNode` can be mapped from disk into
//!   memory without any post-processing (e.g., "abomination-style" pointer
//!   reconstruction).
//! * Because a `DepNode` is self-contained, we can instantiate `DepNodes` that
//!   refer to things that do not exist anymore. In previous implementations
//!   `DepNode` contained a `DefId`. A `DepNode` referring to something that
//!   had been removed between the previous and the current compilation session
//!   could not be instantiated because the current compilation session
//!   contained no `DefId` for thing that had been removed.
//!
//! `DepNode` definition happens in `crablangc_middle` with the `define_dep_nodes!()` macro.
//! This macro defines the `DepKind` enum and a corresponding `DepConstructor` enum. The
//! `DepConstructor` enum links a `DepKind` to the parameters that are needed at runtime in order
//! to construct a valid `DepNode` fingerprint.
//!
//! Because the macro sees what parameters a given `DepKind` requires, it can
//! "infer" some properties for each kind of `DepNode`:
//!
//! * Whether a `DepNode` of a given kind has any parameters at all. Some
//!   `DepNode`s could represent global concepts with only one value.
//! * Whether it is possible, in principle, to reconstruct a query key from a
//!   given `DepNode`. Many `DepKind`s only require a single `DefId` parameter,
//!   in which case it is possible to map the node's fingerprint back to the
//!   `DefId` it was computed from. In other cases, too much information gets
//!   lost during fingerprint computation.
