//! A folding traversal mechanism for complex data structures that contain type
//! information.
//!
//! This is a modifying traversal. It consumes the data structure, producing a
//! (possibly) modified version of it. Both fallible and infallible versions are
//! available. The name is potentially confusing, because this traversal is more
//! like `Iterator::map` than `Iterator::fold`.
//!
//! This traversal has limited flexibility. Only a small number of "types of
//! interest" within the complex data structures can receive custom
//! modification. These are the ones containing the most important type-related
//! information, such as `Ty`, `Predicate`, `Region`, and `Const`.
//!
//! There are three groups of traits involved in each traversal.
//! - `TypeFoldable`. This is implemented once for many types, including:
//!   - Types of interest, for which the methods delegate to the folder.
//!   - All other types, including generic containers like `Vec` and `Option`.
//!     It defines a "skeleton" of how they should be folded.
//! - `TypeSuperFoldable`. This is implemented only for each type of interest,
//!   and defines the folding "skeleton" for these types.
//! - `TypeFolder`/`FallibleTypeFolder`. One of these is implemented for each
//!   folder. This defines how types of interest are folded.
//!
//! This means each fold is a mixture of (a) generic folding operations, and (b)
//! custom fold operations that are specific to the folder.
//! - The `TypeFoldable` impls handle most of the traversal, and call into
//!   `TypeFolder`/`FallibleTypeFolder` when they encounter a type of interest.
//! - A `TypeFolder`/`FallibleTypeFolder` may call into another `TypeFoldable`
//!   impl, because some of the types of interest are recursive and can contain
//!   other types of interest.
//! - A `TypeFolder`/`FallibleTypeFolder` may also call into a `TypeSuperFoldable`
//!   impl, because each folder might provide custom handling only for some types
//!   of interest, or only for some variants of each type of interest, and then
//!   use default traversal for the remaining cases.
//!
//! For example, if you have `struct S(Ty, U)` where `S: TypeFoldable` and `U:
//! TypeFoldable`, and an instance `s = S(ty, u)`, it would be folded like so:
//! ```text
//! s.fold_with(folder) calls
//! - ty.fold_with(folder) calls
//!   - folder.fold_ty(ty) may call
//!     - ty.super_fold_with(folder)
//! - u.fold_with(folder)
//! ```
