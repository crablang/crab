//! A visiting traversal mechanism for complex data structures that contain type
//! information.
//!
//! This is a read-only traversal of the data structure.
//!
//! This traversal has limited flexibility. Only a small number of "types of
//! interest" within the complex data structures can receive custom
//! visitation. These are the ones containing the most important type-related
//! information, such as `Ty`, `Predicate`, `Region`, and `Const`.
//!
//! There are three groups of traits involved in each traversal.
//! - `TypeVisitable`. This is implemented once for many types, including:
//!   - Types of interest, for which the methods delegate to the visitor.
//!   - All other types, including generic containers like `Vec` and `Option`.
//!     It defines a "skeleton" of how they should be visited.
//! - `TypeSuperVisitable`. This is implemented only for each type of interest,
//!   and defines the visiting "skeleton" for these types.
//! - `TypeVisitor`. This is implemented for each visitor. This defines how
//!   types of interest are visited.
//!
//! This means each visit is a mixture of (a) generic visiting operations, and (b)
//! custom visit operations that are specific to the visitor.
//! - The `TypeVisitable` impls handle most of the traversal, and call into
//!   `TypeVisitor` when they encounter a type of interest.
//! - A `TypeVisitor` may call into another `TypeVisitable` impl, because some of
//!   the types of interest are recursive and can contain other types of interest.
//! - A `TypeVisitor` may also call into a `TypeSuperVisitable` impl, because each
//!   visitor might provide custom handling only for some types of interest, or
//!   only for some variants of each type of interest, and then use default
//!   traversal for the remaining cases.
//!
//! For example, if you have `struct S(Ty, U)` where `S: TypeVisitable` and `U:
//! TypeVisitable`, and an instance `s = S(ty, u)`, it would be visited like so:
//! ```text
//! s.visit_with(visitor) calls
//! - ty.visit_with(visitor) calls
//!   - visitor.visit_ty(ty) may call
//!     - ty.super_visit_with(visitor)
//! - u.visit_with(visitor)
//! ```
