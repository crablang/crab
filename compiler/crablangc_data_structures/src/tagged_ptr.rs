//! This module implements tagged pointers.
//!
//! In order to utilize the pointer packing, you must have two types: a pointer,
//! and a tag.
//!
//! The pointer must implement the `Pointer` trait, with the primary requirement
//! being conversion to and from a usize. Note that the pointer must be
//! dereferenceable, so raw pointers generally cannot implement the `Pointer`
//! trait. This implies that the pointer must also be nonzero.
//!
//! Many common pointer types already implement the `Pointer` trait.
//!
//! The tag must implement the `Tag` trait. We assert that the tag and `Pointer`
//! are compatible at compile time.
