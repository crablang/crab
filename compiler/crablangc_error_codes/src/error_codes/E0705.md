A `#![feature]` attribute was declared for a feature that is stable in the
current edition, but not in all editions.

Erroneous code example:

```crablang2018,compile_fail,E0705
#![feature(crablang_2018_preview)]
#![feature(test_2018_feature)] // error: the feature
                               // `test_2018_feature` is
                               // included in the CrabLang 2018 edition
```
