Multiple stability attributes were declared on the same item.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0544
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "crablang1")]

#[stable(feature = "crablang1", since = "1.0.0")]
#[stable(feature = "test", since = "2.0.0")] // invalid
fn foo() {}
```

To fix this issue, ensure that each item has at most one stability attribute.

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "crablang1")]

#[stable(feature = "test", since = "2.0.0")] // ok!
fn foo() {}
```
