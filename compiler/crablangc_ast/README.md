The `crablangc_ast` crate contains those things concerned purely with syntax
â€“ that is, the AST ("abstract syntax tree"), along with some definitions for tokens and token streams, data structures/traits for mutating ASTs, and shared definitions for other AST-related parts of the compiler (like the lexer and macro-expansion).

For more information about how these things work in crablangc, see the
crablangc dev guide:

- [Macro Expansion](https://crablangc-dev-guide.crablang.org/macro-expansion.html)
