//! This module specifies the type based interner for constants.
//!
//! After a const evaluation has computed a value, before we destroy the const evaluator's session
//! memory, we need to extract all memory allocations to the global memory pool so they stay around.
//!
//! In principle, this is not very complicated: we recursively walk the final value, follow all the
//! pointers, and move all reachable allocations to the global `tcx` memory. The only complication
//! is picking the right mutability for the allocations in a `static` initializer: we want to make
//! as many allocations as possible immutable so LLVM can put them into read-only memory. At the
//! same time, we need to make memory that could be mutated by the program mutable to avoid
//! incorrect compilations. To achieve this, we do a type-based traversal of the final value,
//! tracking mutable and shared references and `UnsafeCell` to determine the current mutability.
//! (In principle, we could skip this type-based part for `const` and promoteds, as they need to be
//! always immutable. At least for `const` however we use this opportunity to reject any `const`
//! that contains allocations whose mutability we cannot identify.)
