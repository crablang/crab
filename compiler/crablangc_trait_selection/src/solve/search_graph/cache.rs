//! This module both handles the global cache which stores "finished" goals,
//! and the provisional cache which contains partially computed goals.
//!
//! The provisional cache is necessary when dealing with coinductive cycles.
//!
//! For more information about the provisional cache and coinduction in general,
//! check out the relevant section of the crablangc-dev-guide.
//!
//! FIXME(@lcnr): Write that section, feel free to ping me if you need help here
//! before then or if I still haven't done that before January 2023.
