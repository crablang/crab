   40|       |The `PartialOrd` derived by `Version` happened to generate a MIR that generated coverage
   41|       |without a code region associated with any `Counter`. Code regions were associated with at least
   42|       |one expression, which is allowed, but the `function_source_hash` was only passed to the codegen
   43|       |(coverage mapgen) phase from a `Counter`s code region. A new method was added to pass the
   44|       |`function_source_hash` without a code region, if necessary.
