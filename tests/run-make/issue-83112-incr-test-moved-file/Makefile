# Regression test for issue #83112
# The generated test harness code contains spans with a dummy location,
# but a non-dummy SyntaxContext. Previously, the incremental cache was encoding
# these spans as a full span (with a source file index), instead of skipping
# the encoding of the location information. If the file gest moved, the hash
# of the span will be unchanged (since it has a dummy location), so the incr
# cache would end up try to load a non-existent file using the previously
# enccoded source file id.
