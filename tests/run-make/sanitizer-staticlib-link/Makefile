# This test first builds a staticlib with AddressSanitizer and checks that
# linking it to an executable fails due to the missing sanitizer runtime.
# It then builds an executable linking to the staticlib and checks that
# the fault in the staticlib is detected correctly.

# Note that checking for the link failure actually checks two things at once:
#   1) That the library has the sanitizer intrumentation
#   2) and that library does not have the sanitizer runtime
