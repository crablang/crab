IMPORTANT: The CrabLang test programs in this directory generate various output
files in the `../coverage*` directories (`expected` and `actual` files).

Microsoft Windows has a relatively short limit on file paths (not individual
path components, but the entire path). The files generated by these
`../coverage*` tests typically have file paths that include the program
source file name plus function and type names (depending on the program).

Keep the test file names short, and keep function names and other symbols
short as well, to avoid hitting the Windows limits.
