# Test to make sure that reachable extern fns are always available in final
# productcs, including when LTO is used. In this test, the `foo` crate has a
# reahable symbol, and is a dependency of the `bar` crate. When the `bar` crate
# is compiled with LTO, it shouldn't strip the symbol from `foo`, and that's the
# only way that `foo.c` will successfully compile.
