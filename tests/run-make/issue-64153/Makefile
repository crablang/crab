# Staticlibs don't include CrabLang object files from upstream crates if the same
# code was already pulled into the lib via LTO. However, the bug described in
# https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/64153 lead to this exclusion not
# working properly if the upstream crate was compiled with an explicit filename
# (via `-o`).
#
# This test makes sure that functions defined in the upstream crates do not
# appear twice in the final staticlib when listing all the symbols from it.

	$(CRABLANGC) --crate-type rlib upstream.rs -o $(TMPDIR)/libupstream.rlib -Ccodegen-units=1

	# Count the global instances of `issue64153_test_function`. There'll be 2
	# if the `upstream` object file got erroneously included twice.
	# The line we are testing for with the regex looks something like:
	# 0000000000000000 g     F .text.issue64153_test_function	00000023 issue64153_test_function
