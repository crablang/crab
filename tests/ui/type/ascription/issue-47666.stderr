   |                   |     this macro call doesn't expand to a type

   = note: `#![feature(type_ascription)]` lets you annotate an expression with a type: `<expr>: <type>`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__crablang_force_expr` which comes from the expansion of the macro `vec` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
