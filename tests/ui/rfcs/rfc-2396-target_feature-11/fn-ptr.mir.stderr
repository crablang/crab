   = note: expected fn pointer `fn()`
                 found fn item `fn() {foo}`
   = note: fn items are distinct from fn pointers
   = note: functions with `#[target_feature]` can only be coerced to `unsafe` function pointers
   = note: when the arguments and return types match, functions can be coerced to function pointers
help: consider casting to a fn pointer
