error[E0033]: type `&dyn SomeTrait` cannot be dereferenced

   |         ^^^^^^^^ type `&dyn SomeTrait` cannot be dereferenced
   |
   = note: This error indicates that a pointer to a trait type cannot be implicitly dereferenced by a pattern. Every trait defines a type, but because the size of trait implementors isn't fixed, this type has no compile-time size. Therefore, all accesses to trait types must be through pointers. If you encounter this error you should try to avoid dereferencing the pointer.
