   = help: the trait `ImplementedForUnitButNotNever` is implemented for `()`
   = note: this error might have been caused by changes to CrabLang's type-inference algorithm (see issue #48950 <https://github.com/crablang/crablang/issues/48950> for more information)
   = help: did you intend to use the type `()` here instead?
