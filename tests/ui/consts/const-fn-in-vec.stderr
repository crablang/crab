error[E0277]: the trait bound `String: Copy` is not satisfied

LL |     let strings: [String; 5] = [String::new(); 5];
   |                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `String`
   |
   = note: the `Copy` trait is required because this value will be copied for each element of the array
   = help: consider creating a new `const` item and initializing it with the result of the function call to be used in the repeat position, like `const VAL: Type = const_fn();` and `let x = [VAL; 42];`
   = help: create an inline `const` block, see RFC #2920 <https://github.com/crablang/rfcs/pull/2920> for more information
