  --> $DIR/closure-origin-struct-diagnostics.rs:21:13

LL |     let b = hello;
   |             ----- value moved here
LL |     let c = hello;
   |             ^^^^^ value used here after move

note: closure cannot be moved more than once as it is not `Copy` due to moving the variable `x.y.a` out of its environment
  --> $DIR/closure-origin-struct-diagnostics.rs:17:9

LL |         x.y.a += 1;
   |         ^^^^^
help: consider mutably borrowing `hello`

LL |     let b = &mut hello;
