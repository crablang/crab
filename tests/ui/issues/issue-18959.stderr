error[E0038]: the trait `Bar` cannot be made into an object

   |            ^^^^^^^ `Bar` cannot be made into an object

note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.crablang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL | pub trait Foo { fn foo<T>(&self, ext_thing: &T); }
   |                    ^^^ ...because method `foo` has generic type parameters
LL | pub trait Bar: Foo { }

   = help: consider moving `foo` to another trait
