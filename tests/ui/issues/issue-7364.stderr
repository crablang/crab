LL | static boxed: Box<RefCell<isize>> = Box::new(RefCell::new(0));
   |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `RefCell<isize>` cannot be shared between threads safely
   |
   = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `RefCell<isize>`
   = note: if you want to do aliasing and mutation between multiple threads, use `std::sync::RwLock` instead
   = note: required for `Unique<RefCell<isize>>` to implement `Sync`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `Box<RefCell<isize>>`
   = note: shared static variables must have a type that implements `Sync`
