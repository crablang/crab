LL | struct Test;
   | ----------- unit struct defined here
...
LL |         let Test = 1;
   |             ^^^^   - this expression has type `{integer}`
   |             |
   |             expected integer, found `Test`
   |             `Test` is interpreted as a unit struct, not a new binding
   |             help: introduce a new binding instead: `other_test`
