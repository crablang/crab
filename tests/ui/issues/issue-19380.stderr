note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.crablang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL |   fn qiz();

help: consider turning `qiz` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument

LL |   fn qiz(&self);

help: alternatively, consider constraining `qiz` so it does not apply to trait objects
