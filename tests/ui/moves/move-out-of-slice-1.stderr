error[E0508]: cannot move out of type `[A]`, a non-copy slice
  --> $DIR/move-out-of-slice-1.rs:7:11

   |           ^ cannot move out of here

   |              |
   |              data moved here
   |              move occurs because `a` has type `A`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

help: consider borrowing the pattern binding
