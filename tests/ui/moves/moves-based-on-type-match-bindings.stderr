error[E0382]: borrow of partially moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/moves-based-on-type-match-bindings.rs:16:11
   |
LL |         Foo {f} => {}
   |              - value partially moved here
...
LL |     touch(&x);
   |           ^^ value borrowed here after partial move
   |
   = note: partial move occurs because `x.f` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
help: borrow this binding in the pattern to avoid moving the value
