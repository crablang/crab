LL |     fn key_set(&self) -> Subject<'a, Keys<K, V>, (), R> {
   |                ^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: replace this type to make the impl signature compatible: `Subject<'_, std::collections::hash_map::Keys<'_, K, V>, (), R>`

   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
