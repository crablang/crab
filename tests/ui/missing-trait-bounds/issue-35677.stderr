error[E0599]: the method `is_subset` exists for reference `&HashSet<T>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `T: Eq`
           `T: PartialEq`
           which is required by `T: Eq`
           `T: Hash`
help: consider restricting the type parameters to satisfy the trait bounds
