error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*y` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/borrowck-issue-2657-2.rs:8:18
   |
LL |         let _b = *y;
   |                  ^^ move occurs because `*y` has type `Box<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
help: consider removing the dereference here
   |
LL -         let _b = *y;
LL +         let _b = y;
