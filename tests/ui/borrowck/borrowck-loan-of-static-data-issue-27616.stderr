LL |     let alias: &'static mut String = s;
   |                -------------------   - `*s` is borrowed here
   |                |
   |                type annotation requires that `*s` is borrowed for `'static`
...
LL |     *s = String::new();
   |     ^^ `*s` is assigned to here but it was already borrowed
