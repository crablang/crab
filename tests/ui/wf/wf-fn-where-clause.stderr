error[E0038]: the trait `Copy` cannot be made into an object

LL | fn bar() where Vec<dyn Copy>:, {}
   |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Copy` cannot be made into an object
   |
   = note: the trait cannot be made into an object because it requires `Self: Sized`
   = note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.crablang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>
