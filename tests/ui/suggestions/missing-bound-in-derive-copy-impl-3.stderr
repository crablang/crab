   |     ------------------- this field does not implement `Copy`

note: the `Copy` impl for `Vector2<K>` requires that `K: Debug`

   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Copy` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider further restricting this bound
