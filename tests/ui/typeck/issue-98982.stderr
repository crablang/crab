note: the function expects a value to always be returned, but loops might run zero times

LL |     for i in 0..0 {
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this might have zero elements to iterate on
LL |
LL |         return i;
   |         -------- if the loop doesn't execute, this value would never get returned
   = help: return a value for the case when the loop has zero elements to iterate on, or consider changing the return type to account for that possibility
