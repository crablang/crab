LL |     assert_is_send(test::<T>());
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^ future returned by `test` is not `Send`
   |
   = help: within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `impl Future<Output = ()>`
note: future is not `Send` as it awaits another future which is not `Send`

LL |     T::bar().await;

note: required by a bound in `assert_is_send`
