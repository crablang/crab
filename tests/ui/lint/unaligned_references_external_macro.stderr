error[E0793]: reference to packed field is unaligned

   = note: fields of packed structs are not properly aligned, and creating a misaligned reference is undefined behavior (even if that reference is never dereferenced)
   = help: copy the field contents to a local variable, or replace the reference with a raw pointer and use `read_unaligned`/`write_unaligned` (loads and stores via `*p` must be properly aligned even when using raw pointers)
   = note: this error originates in the macro `unaligned_references_external_crate::mac` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
