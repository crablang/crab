# Options for specific targets

# Each of the following options is scoped to the specific target triple in
# question and is used for determining how to compile each target.
# =============================================================================
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]

# C compiler to be used to compile C code. Note that the
# default value is platform specific, and if not specified it may also depend on
# what platform is crossing to what platform.
# See `src/bootstrap/cc_detect.rs` for details.
#cc = "cc" (path)

# C++ compiler to be used to compile C++ code (e.g. LLVM and our LLVM shims).
# This is only used for host targets.
# See `src/bootstrap/cc_detect.rs` for details.
#cxx = "c++" (path)

# Archiver to be used to assemble static libraries compiled from C/C++ code.
# Note: an absolute path should be used, otherwise LLVM build will break.
#ar = "ar" (path)

# Ranlib to be used to assemble static libraries compiled from C/C++ code.
# Note: an absolute path should be used, otherwise LLVM build will break.
#ranlib = "ranlib" (path)

# Linker to be used to bootstrap Rust code. Note that the
# default value is platform specific, and if not specified it may also depend on
# what platform is crossing to what platform.
# Setting this will override the `use-lld` option for Rust code when targeting MSVC.
#linker = "cc" (path)

# Path to the `llvm-config` binary of the installation of a custom LLVM to link
# against. Note that if this is specified we don't compile LLVM at all for this
# target.

# Override detection of whether this is a Rust-patched LLVM. This would be used
# in conjunction with either an llvm-config or build.submodules = false.

# Normally the build system can find LLVM's FileCheck utility, but if
# not, you can specify an explicit file name for it.

# Use LLVM libunwind as the implementation for Rust's unwinder.
# Accepted values are 'in-tree' (formerly true), 'system' or 'no' (formerly false).
# This option only applies for Linux and Fuchsia targets.
# On Linux target, if crt-static is not enabled, 'no' means dynamic link to
# `libgcc_s.so`, 'in-tree' means static link to the in-tree build of llvm libunwind
# and 'system' means dynamic link to `libunwind.so`. If crt-static is enabled,
# the behavior is depend on the libc. On musl target, 'no' and 'in-tree' both
# means static link to the in-tree build of llvm libunwind, and 'system' means
# static link to `libunwind.a` provided by system. Due to the limitation of glibc,
# it must link to `libgcc_eh.a` to get a working output, and this option have no effect.
#llvm-libunwind = 'no' if Linux, 'in-tree' if Fuchsia

# If this target is for Android, this option will be required to specify where
# the NDK for the target lives. This is used to find the C compiler to link and
# build native code.
# See `src/bootstrap/cc_detect.rs` for details.

# on this runtime, such as `-C profile-generate` or `-C instrument-coverage`).
# This option will override the same option under [build] section.

# This option supports enable `rpath` in each target independently,
# and will override the same option under [rust] section. It only works on Unix platforms
#rpath = rust.rpath (bool)

# Force static or dynamic linkage of the standard library for this target. If
# this target is a host for rustc, this will also affect the linkage of the
# compiler itself. This is useful for building rustc on targets that normally
# only use static libraries. If unset, the target's default linkage is used.
#crt-static = <platform-specific> (bool)

# The root location of the musl installation directory. The library directory
# will also need to contain libunwind.a for an unwinding implementation. Note
# that this option only makes sense for musl targets that produce statically
# linked binaries.

#musl-libdir = musl-root/lib

# The root location of the `wasm32-wasi` sysroot. Only used for the
# `wasm32-wasi` target. If you are building wasm32-wasi target, make sure to
# create a `[target.wasm32-wasi]` section and move this field there.
